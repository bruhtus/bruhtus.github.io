<p>Recently i watched Dr. K&rsquo;s video on
<a href="https://youtu.be/ZpZvAalAYI0?si=eciDSjPdpxOQYgd2" target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">youtube</a>
. He talks about
&ldquo;why &lsquo;the grind&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t meant for everyone&rdquo; and one of things he said on those
video is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We live in a society that glorifies exhaustion at work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that make me thinking, that&rsquo;s not the end of it. If you ever talk to a
friend and said &ldquo;i have a lot of tasks at work&rdquo; and then explain those all
those tasks, your friend be like &ldquo;you got off better, i need to do more work
than that&rdquo; like they are proud of it. When my friend did that, i am like
&ldquo;why does this sounds like we are competing to have the worst experience at
work?&rdquo; which honestly, kind of funny to me. Am i weird thinking like that?
I hope not.</p>
<p>When Dr. K said that the society glorifies exhaustion at work and proud of it,
i want to add that some people also competing for it, to see which one can
have the worst experience at work. And guess what? That&rsquo;s not gonna make the
work environment better because <em>no one</em> complains, and when someone complains,
they will be the <em>weirdo</em> in those work environment.</p>
<p>And this is not limited to work, this can also apply to another experience
outside of work too. That&rsquo;s why i&rsquo;ve been thinking, is this a human nature? Or
maybe the society standard just getting worst?</p>
<p>Personally, i don&rsquo;t really encourage anyone to compete on who has the worst
experience because, <em>even if your experience is not the worst</em>, that does not
mean <em>it is not bad</em>. It&rsquo;s still bad, it&rsquo;s just not the worst thing that could
happen. And by competing who has the worst experience, we are basically
tolerating bad experience, and that behavior can lower the society standard
even further if a lot of people doing that.</p>
