<p>At the time of writing this post, there&rsquo;s some sort of AI hype going around,
and some of the testimonies is that AI make people &ldquo;learn faster&rdquo; or
&ldquo;doing stuff faster&rdquo;. With that in mind, i&rsquo;ve been wondering, why did people
want to be &ldquo;faster&rdquo; or do things &ldquo;instantly&rdquo;? When writing this blog post,
i still have no idea why, but i know that this mentality can be bad.</p>
<p>First off, some people want to &ldquo;learn faster&rdquo;, and i&rsquo;m like <em>and then what</em>?
What would these people do after learning as fast as they can? Scrolling
social media? If that is your goal, then i think you are putting the horse
before the cart.</p>
<p>Personally, i try to have this &ldquo;student mentality&rdquo; where i treat learning
as daily activity. I don&rsquo;t want to rush my learning process because i don&rsquo;t
want to have a premature knowledge. In my unscientific observation, the
biggest problem of self-learner is that some of them tend to be
&ldquo;overconfident&rdquo;. Those people tend to blindly believe with the <em>only</em>
reference they have, without even considering that the reference can be
misleading. As a self-learner myself, this is the reason i don&rsquo;t want my
learning phase to end as fast as possible. I don&rsquo;t want to be overconfident
and think that i&rsquo;ve learn everything that is to learn. There&rsquo;s a possibility
that what i&rsquo;ve learn this far is not accurate, especially if i don&rsquo;t have any
experience with the topic.</p>
<p>If you just <em>blindly</em> trust what AI say without any experience in the subject,
then i think it can be more <em>harmful</em> rather than helpful. AI can be good to
find <em>the unknown</em>, finding something that we didn&rsquo;t know before, <em>and then</em>
find some proper references for those subject. We could say that AI make the
process of <em>finding the unknown</em> faster than reading the documentation
ourself, but are we really learning faster that way? How can we be sure that
we&rsquo;re done learning the subject? If you are trying to learn as fast as
possible, you might set up yourself for premature knowledge.</p>
<p>Now, let go into &ldquo;doing stuff faster&rdquo;, again, <em>and then what</em>? In the past,
i&rsquo;ve been working so fast that my team leader asking me to slow down because
other teammates <em>can not keep up</em> with my pace, and that was <em>before</em> the
current AI hype cycle. Whether you believe me or not, i&rsquo;ve been in a position
to <em>do things as fast as possible</em> and that do more harm to the team rather
than being helpful.</p>
<p>You might be thinking, &ldquo;then your teammates need to raise up their pace&rdquo;,
<em>and then what</em>? We are racing to see who can finish the most tasks and got
burned along the way? Believe it or not, i&rsquo;ve experience that too. For some
reason, the people on the teams trying to compete to see who can finish
the most task in the team, this happen <em>in</em> the current AI hype cycle. In
those team, i&rsquo;m <em>the slow one</em> because i&rsquo;ve seen how exhausted my teammates
in previous team when i set the pace too high, so i intentionally slowing
down pace. <strong>But</strong>, that does not mean i become slow, i just putting
off my result out there.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example, let&rsquo;s say i need to make some feature, i already done
that with &ldquo;mechanism A&rdquo;, but i did not submit &ldquo;mechanism A&rdquo; and instead
i am trying to brainstorming again and change &ldquo;mechanism A&rdquo; to &ldquo;mechanism B&rdquo;,
and then i have another idea and change &ldquo;mechanism B&rdquo; to &ldquo;mechanism C&rdquo;.
After that, i don&rsquo;t really have any inspiration to improve &ldquo;mechanism C&rdquo; so
i submit &ldquo;mechanism C&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s what i mean by slowing down, i just putting
off the result.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why i feel like &ldquo;doing stuff faster&rdquo; is not always a good thing,
especially when we are working with a team. Setting the pace too high might
not be sustainable in the long run. Unless that&rsquo;s your goal, you don&rsquo;t want to
stay long enough in the industry.</p>
<p>Another example of &ldquo;doing stuff faster&rdquo; is <em>instant messaging</em>. When the first
instant messaging application appear, a lot of people enjoying it, they be
like &ldquo;wow, we can contact other people <em>instantly</em>&rdquo; and then years latter
realizing that <em>instant messaging</em> setting the bar too high for <em>how fast</em> we
should respond. Because of instant messaging, a lot of people expect us to
respond <strong>immediately</strong>, it&rsquo;s like our entire time is just waiting on
instant messaging application. These expectation can create anxiety in some
cases, and one of them is when working remotely. When we are working remotely,
we can working from anywhere as long as we have internet access, but the dark
side of working remotely is that, when we don&rsquo;t separate <em>working</em> and
<em>resting</em> phase, we will be working 24 hours a day. And if our company did not
have a clear policy, we will be in <em>sword of damocles</em> situation, basically
it&rsquo;s like we have a <em>sword</em> hanging above our head all day long.</p>
<p>These mindset that we need to be &ldquo;faster&rdquo; or the expectation for something to
be &ldquo;instant&rdquo; can be harmful for the society in some cases, so we need to keep
that mindset in check.</p>
