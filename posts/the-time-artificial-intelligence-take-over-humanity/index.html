<h2 id=a-brief-intro>A Brief Intro</h2>
<p>One evening i read an article about <a href=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bill-gates-could-ask-time-152241140.html target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">if bill gates could ask a time traveller,
he&rsquo;d want to know whether AI eventually doomed or helped
humanity</a>
.</p>
<p>Those question is quite interesting, no one really know if artificial
intelligence (AI) will helped or doomed humanity and here&rsquo;s my take.</p>
<h2 id=main-point>Main Point</h2>
<p>Rather than explaining about the history of AI that only a few people cares,
let&rsquo;s talk about what make people scared about AI.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this topic about AI will take over humanity, or doomed humanity, or
ending the humankind, etc. In my opinion, those kind of topic can become reality
on one condition, <strong>when the human intelligence is lower than the artificial
intelligence</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, you might be thinking, &ldquo;well, the current AI is smarter than me because i
can&rsquo;t solve those specific problem&rdquo;, and guess what? The AI might not be able
to solve the problem that you can solve. The AI will give a better answer if
they have a better material for their training, and you know what? Human is
not that different, the AI might be able to solve the problem you can&rsquo;t solve
because they have resources that you don&rsquo;t have as their learning material
(which can be questionable from the legal perspective).</p>
<p>The point is, AI also need training to increase their intelligence. Now, this
is something that scared me personally. As the AI become more advance, human&rsquo;s
training or learning slowing down. I&rsquo;ve seen a few people <em>mindlessly</em> take
any output from the AI and present them as their answer or solution. It&rsquo;s like
they use AI as a reason to decrease or stop learning altogether.</p>
<p>I understand that laziness can be the source of innovation, and one of those
innovation is automation. Most of the time, human use automation to handle
repetitive task. Will automation doomed humanity? Not really, because the most
advance automation still need human supervision from time to time. Some people
might lose their job because of automation, but at the same time, those kind
of jobs, which do repetitive task should be left to the machine instead of
human to increase human&rsquo;s quality of life. If you want an example of a job
that get replaced by machine, you can check the history of glass bottle, how
people back in the day make glass bottle manually.</p>
<p>Clearly teaching a machine or a system to do some task can be beneficial for
human. You could say those machine or system that human teach, is more like an
assistant instead of a replacement. We, as a human, still need to supervise those
machine or system, and to be able to do that, we can&rsquo;t stop our learning process
so that we can stop the machine or system when they misbehave and potentially
endanger human life.</p>
<p>So, in this post i want to remind people that if they are scared AI will
doomed humanity, then they should keep learning and prevent that from
happening themselves. Do you think that human intelligence will lose to
artificial intelligence? We will see.</p>
