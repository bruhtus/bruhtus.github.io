<p>Recently i read about Simon Sinek&rsquo;s post about <a href=https://simonsinek.com/stories/would-you-still-lead-if-no-one-ever-knew-your-name/ target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">would you still lead if no one
ever knew your
name?</a>
and my answer to those question is a solid &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. Here&rsquo;s the story,
back then we have two senior-level teammates on our team, one of them is in the
official leader of the project and another one is not. Because i am new at my
role, i am still struggling at the beginning of the project, and surprisingly
the non-lead senior-level teammate reach out to me and saying &ldquo;Hey, do you have
some difficulty with your task? If so, you can ask me&rdquo;. He didn&rsquo;t have to, but
he still reach out to me and as someone who is trying to understand how to do
the task, that means a lot to me.</p>
<p>Since then, i will always try to help if i can, even if i am not the &ldquo;official&rdquo;
leader of the project. That&rsquo;s because i want to create a team that will cover
each other&rsquo;s back. You might be surprised that by me helping other teammates
in need, overtime, my teammates also helping me too. Like Simon&rsquo;s said in his
post, creating the &ldquo;Circle of Safety&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why when i read Simon&rsquo;s post, it resonates with me. Leadership is not
about the position, it&rsquo;s the act of service. These consistent act of service
will create trust between each others, and those trust will create a &ldquo;safety&rdquo;
environment where we can thrive together.</p>
<p>So, if you are not sure how to lead other people or how to become a leader,
you might want to start helping other people, even if it&rsquo;s not your
responsibility.</p>
<p>P.S: Here&rsquo;s another quote from Simon Sinek about leadership:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The joy of leadership comes from seeing others achieve more than they
thought they were capable of.</p>
</blockquote>
