<p>After watching video about acme
<a href=https://research.swtch.com/acme target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">in this article</a>
, which introduces the
concept of Integrating Development Environment instead of Integrated
Development Environment which usually abbreviated to IDE, i thought to myself
&ldquo;why not having a development environment without integration at all?&rdquo;. This
might sound crazy for some people, but this is my development environment at
the time of writing this post.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, this approach might not be suitable for some software
development, such as game development. The point is, this post is just for
reference about someone else&rsquo;s development environment.</p>
<p>In my time as a linux user, not even as a software developer, i realize that
there&rsquo;s a cost of integration and one of them is <em>maintenance</em>. Here&rsquo;s a
little bit of a back story when i found that out. Back then when i use
elementary OS, which is ubuntu-based linux distro, i try to upgrade into
the newer version, and guess what? I can&rsquo;t use the &ldquo;default&rdquo; image viewer.
Because i can&rsquo;t use the &ldquo;default&rdquo; image viewer, i need another image viewer
which lead me to install another image viewer. Now i have 2 image viewer on my
system which i feel like redundant. So, as a new linux user, i try to
uninstall the &ldquo;default&rdquo; image viewer, and guess what? It break the entire
desktop environment. Isn&rsquo;t that nice? Like hell it is!</p>
<p>That incident make me realized that when we tightly integrated our software
with each other, when one software break or missing, our system might falling
apart.</p>
<p>Another example is the &ldquo;breaking changes&rdquo; culture of modern software
development. In my observation, software development nowadays does not really
care about improving user experience, it&rsquo;s more like making the changes for the
sake of &ldquo;there&rsquo;s some new changes&rdquo;. Whether those new changes is useful to the
user or not, that doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>The point is, when something break because of an update in our integration
system, it&rsquo;s kind of hard to find out the problem. Especially if we&rsquo;re using
&ldquo;modern software&rdquo; which most likely introduce &ldquo;breaking changes&rdquo; on every
release.</p>
<p>My base development environment is <code>tmux</code>, and my text editor is <code>vim</code>. Other
than that? I use <code>shell</code>. The majority of my workflow is using <code>shell</code>.
I didn&rsquo;t integrate my text editor or <code>shell</code> with <code>tmux</code>. I could change my
text editor or shell to something else, and it won&rsquo;t effect my <code>tmux</code>
configuration. When i changed my <code>tmux</code> configuration or <code>tmux</code> introduce
breaking changes, it won&rsquo;t effect my text editor or shell.</p>
<p>Because my development environment is not integrated with each other, i have
the flexibility of changing things. Which can be a good thing or a bad thing,
depends on personal preferences.</p>
<p>So, the point is that we need to approach integration with caution. Not
everything need to be integrated with each other. We also need to realize that
integration has a cost, and one of them is maintenance.</p>
