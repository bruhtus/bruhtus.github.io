And when you want to take down all those docker container from the docker-compose.yml, you already delete the file?\nIf that\u0026rsquo;s the case, then this post might be for you.\nBefore we start, we will be using docker compose version 2.16.0 in this post. If you are using the older version of docker compose, then this method might not work. Please keep that in mind.\nCheck Docker Compose Project Name The first thing we need to do is to check the project name. We can do that with command:\ndocker-compose ls or if we use docker compose v2, we can use this command instead:\ndocker compose ls If the container already stopped, we can use flags -a or --all like this:\ndocker-compose ls -a or this:\ndocker compose ls -a By default, docker compose will use the docker-compose.yml directory name as project name. We can specify the project name with flag -p or --project-name like this:\ndocker-compose -p anu up -d or this:\ndocker compose -p anu up -d Please keep in mind that we need to use the flags -p or --project-name before the command such as up or down.\nTake Down Docker Compose Component After we know the project name, we can take down all docker component when we spin up the docker container from docker-compose.yml. The component in here means volume, network, or anything that we define inside docker-compose.yml.\nTo take down component from docker compose without the docker-compose.yml, we can use this command:\ndocker-compose -p project-name down \u0026lt;docker-compose-down-flags\u0026gt; or this:\ndocker compose -p project-name down \u0026lt;docker-compose-down-flags\u0026gt; For example, let\u0026rsquo;s say we want to take down docker component from project anu and also remove the volume from those project. We can do that with this command:\ndocker-compose -p anu down -v or this:\ndocker compose -p anu down -v Alright, that\u0026rsquo;s it!\nI am not sure since when the ls command appear in docker compose, so just to be safe i recommend using at least docker compose version 2.16.0.\nSide Note I\u0026rsquo;ve tried this method with docker compose version 1.18.0, but failed. After i downloaded the docker compose binary version 2.16.0 from github, i can use this method.\nStill not sure what was wrong. When i use command docker-compose --help, the flag -p in there. But when i actually spin up a new docker instance with command:\ndocker-compose -p project-name up -d service-name and then tried to take it down with command:\ndocker-compose -p project-name down -v i got an error docker-compose.yml not found or along those lines.\nIf someone know what\u0026rsquo;s going on, please let me know!\n"}]
