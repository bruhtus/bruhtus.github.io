And miryoku QMK haven\u0026rsquo;t porting it\u0026rsquo;s config in the new QMK userspace. So this section might become obsolete in the future. For reference: https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/discussions/287 First thing we need to do is to setup QMK. We can check the QMK documentation below:\nhttps://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/docs/newbs_getting_started.md To check if QMK already installed on linux, we can use this command:\ncommand -v qmk if there\u0026rsquo;s any output, it means QMK is already installed. If there\u0026rsquo;s no output, try again.\nAfter QMK is installed, we need to setup QMK with this command:\nqmk setup By default, the installation directory will be on our home directory. If we don\u0026rsquo;t want to put the QMK installation on my home directory, we can add -H flag to move the installation directory to somewhere else, like this:\nqmk setup -H all-repos/qmk_firmware If the setup already finished, try running:\nqmk doctor and see if there\u0026rsquo;s any issue with the installation.\n If you see a warning about 50-qmk.rules, we might to copy 50-qmk.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d/. Like this: cp path/to/50-qmk.rules /etc/udev/rules.d\n After that, we need to change our working directory qmk_firmware. In qmk_firmware directory, we need to add miryoku_qmk fork like this:\ngit remote add miryoku_qmk https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku_qmk.git git fetch miryoku_qmk git checkout --track miryoku_qmk/miryoku And then we need to merge miryoku with QMK master branch like this:\ngit checkout -b miryoku-merge-master git revert --no-edit `git log --grep=\u0026#39;^\\[miryoku-github\\]\u0026#39; --pretty=\u0026#39;format:%H\u0026#39; | tr \u0026#39;\\n\u0026#39; \u0026#39; \u0026#39;` git fetch origin git merge origin/master and solve all conflict.\nAfter that, we need to copy layouts/community/split_3x5_3/manna-harbour_miryoku/ from miryoku branch into keyboards/bastardkb/skeletyl/keymaps/ in miryoku-merge-master branch. We also need to copy users/manna-harbour_miryoku/ from miryoku branch to users/ in miryoku-merge-master branch.\nAfter that, we need to run this command:\nmake git-submodule Next, we need to make sure that we can compile the miryoku layout by running this command:\nqmk compile -c -kb bastardkb/skeletyl/v2/splinky_3 -km manna-harbour_miryoku -e MIRYOKU_ALPHAS=QWERTY -e MIRYOKU_LAYERS=FLIP -e MIRYOKU_NAV=INVERTEDT  I prefer to use qwerty layout, so i add flag -e MIRYOKU_ALPHAS=QWERTY. Also my unit using rp2040, that\u0026rsquo;s why i\u0026rsquo;m using splinky_3. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure the difference between splinky_2 and splinky_3, and the reason i\u0026rsquo;m using splinky_3 instead of splinky_2 is because i think splinky_3 is the latest version of splinky variant. I prefer to use space on the right side, hence why i put flag -e MIRYOKU_LAYERS=FLIP to flip the base layer thumb keys and sub layers between right and left hands. I also prefer using arrow key in inverted T model, like asdw in fps game, hence why i put flag -e MIRYOKU_NAV=INVERTEDT.\n If there\u0026rsquo;s no error, we can go into the next section. If there\u0026rsquo;s some error, we might need to adjust a few things. Check this discussion and see if this changes fix the error:\n https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/discussions/361  https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/discussions/361#discussioncomment-12243200   Flashing Skeletyl Keyboard The first thing we need to do is make our keyboard enter bootloader mode. In skeletyl keyboard, we can use the update button at the bottom of the keyboard. For more info, we can check this guide:\nhttps://docs.bastardkb.com/fw/flashing.html  Because we using new firmware, we can flash both side with the same firmware.\n After our keyboard enter bootloader mode, we need to mount our micro controller to our linux system. We can use lsblk to find out our micro controller partition name and mount those partition. For example, if our micro controller partition name is sda1, we can use this command to mount our micro controller partition:\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt After that, we can run this command to flash our micro controller with firmware that has miryoku layout in it:\nqmk flash -c -kb bastardkb/skeletyl/v2/splinky_3 -km manna-harbour_miryoku -e MIRYOKU_ALPHAS=QWERTY -e MIRYOKU_LAYERS=FLIP -e MIRYOKU_NAV=INVERTEDT If there\u0026rsquo;s no error, we can use our skeletyl keyboard with miryoku layout after the flashing process finish. If there\u0026rsquo;s an error, you might want to take a look at miryoku discussion or issue on github.\nIf the skeletyl keyboard is not usable after booting up the computer, we can add #define USB_VBUS_PIN GP19 in file keyboards/bastardkb/skeletyl/v2/splinky_3/config.h. Defining USB_VBUS_PIN will allow us to tell the controller whether it\u0026rsquo;s master or slave right away, resulting in immediate boot for both sides. After defining USB_VBUS_PIN, we can flashing both side of the keyboard again using the command above.\nAll right, that\u0026rsquo;s it. See you next time!\nSide Note Currently the right side of miryoku qwerty layout using hjkl' instead of hjkl;, so you might be surprised the first time using miryoku qwerty layout. There\u0026rsquo;s a plan to customize that, but as of writing this post, it\u0026rsquo;s still work in progress. You can check this discussion to see the progress:\nhttps://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/discussions/85 References  Miryoku reference manual  Miryoku build guide  Miryoku breaking change QMK discussion  Skeletyl flashing firmware guide  QMK github issue not usable from boot  Skeletyl USB VBUS PIN for splinky controllers   "},{"ref":"https://bruhtus.github.io/posts/use-arch-linux-vm-for-linux-kernel-testing/","title":"Use Arch Linux VM for Linux Kernel Testing","section":"posts","tags":["Linux"],"date":"2025.03.30","body":"A Brief Intro Have you wondered \u0026ldquo;how can we test a linux kernel without breaking our linux operating system installation?\u0026rdquo;. One of the method is using virtual machine (VM) and in this post we\u0026rsquo;ll use arch linux in virtual machine to try out different version of linux kernel.\nThere are 2 scenarios that we will discuss on this post:\n Using arch linux VM with arch linux as host system. Using arch linux VM with different linux distro as host system.  We\u0026rsquo;re going to work with 2 systems on 1 machine, so we need to know which command need to run on which machine. For that purpose, we\u0026rsquo;re going to use this indicator to differentiate:\n# @host # for real machine system # @guest # for virtual machine system Arch Linux as Host System The prerequisite for this scenario is that we need to use arch linux on the real machine or host machine we want to install the virtual machine.\nAfter we make sure that the host machine system we have is using arch linux, the first thing we need to do is create a file to store arch linux installation for the virtual machine. We can define how much space we\u0026rsquo;ll allocate to the installation, but in this post we\u0026rsquo;ll use 15G just to be save. To create a file for virtual machine OS installation, we can use this command:\n# @host truncate -s 15g arch-linux-disk.raw We can name the file whatever we want, but in this case, we\u0026rsquo;ll use arch-linux-disk.\nAfter that, we need to create a filesystem volume by formatting the file into ext4 with this command:\n# @host mkfs.ext4 arch-linux-disk.raw And then, we can mount the filesystem partition into /mnt like this (assuming we\u0026rsquo;re not login as root user):\n# @host sudo mount arch-linux-disk.raw /mnt  If your /mnt is occupied, you can use another directory such as vm, like this: sudo mount --mkdir arch-linux-disk.raw vm\n After mounting the filesystem, make sure arch-install-scripts and qemu-base package installed on our system by running this command:\n# @host sudo pacman -S arch-install-scripts qemu-base  arch-install-scripts contains some useful scripts to install arch linux such as pacstrap and arch-chroot. qemu-base is for creating the virtual machine we will use later.\n After those packages installed, we can use this command to install arch linux on arch-linux-disk.raw:\n# @host sudo pacstrap -c /mnt base base-devel vim dhcpcd  flag -c is to use package cache on host system, so we only need to download some out of date packages rather than downloading all the packages. base is a package for basic arch linux installation and base-devel is for packages such as sudo and grep. vim is my editor of choice, so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to install this if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to. dhcpcd is to connect the virtual machine system to the internet.\n After everything installed, we can go into the new filesystem with this command:\n# @host sudo arch-chroot /mnt After that, we can setup password for root user with this command:\n# @guest passwd Also, we can start dhcpcd for internet connection on our virtual machine with this command:\n# @guest systemctl enable --now dhcpcd To exit from the guest filesystem, we can use ctrl-d or exit command. After exit from the guest filesystem, we can unmount the filesystem using this command:\n# @host sudo umount /mnt Use Custom Linux Kernel on QEMU VM Before we spin up our virtual machine, we need to compile the linux kernel.\nFirst thing we need to do is download the linux kernel source code from one of available source on https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git . In this post, we will download the source from Linux Torvalds source code. For example, let\u0026rsquo;s say we want to download the source code for tag v6.14, we can use wget like this:\n# @host wget https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/snapshot/linux-6.14.tar.gz Or we can just click on the Download link. Or we can clone the repo with this command:\n# @host git clone --depth=1 git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git torvalds-kernel  --depth=1 means that we download 1 commit instead of all the commits. torvalds-kernel is the directory name where we clone the linux kernel source code git repository (instead of naming it linux, we name it torvalds-kernel).\n After we download the linux kernel source code, we can change directory into it. And then, we can create a basic config x86_64 config using this command:\n# @host make x86_64_defconfig And then we need to add config for virtual machine with this command:\n# @host make kvm_guest.config After that, we can compile the linux kernel with this command:\n# @host make -j \u0026lt;n\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;n\u0026gt; is how much threads we use. For example, make -j 8 means we use 8 threads.\n We can change the config with command:\nmake nconfig  Please keep in mind, DO NOT directly edit the .config file. Use make nconfig instead.\n After we finish compiling the linux kernel, we can use that linux kernel in our QEMU virtual machine with this command:\n# @host qemu-system-x86_64 \\  -hda /path/to/arch-linux-disk.raw \\  -m 2g \\  -nographic \\  -kernel /path/to/linux-6.14/arch/x86/boot/bzImage \\  -append \u0026#34;root=/dev/sda rw console=ttyS0 loglevel=5\u0026#34; \\  -enable-kvm \\  -nic user,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 For example:\n# @host qemu-system-x86_64 \\  -hda $HOME/.local/state/qemu/kernel-dev-disk.raw \\  -m 2g \\  -nographic \\  -kernel $HOME/.local/state/qemu/linux-6.14-rc5/arch/x86/boot/bzImage \\  -append \u0026#34;root=/dev/sda rw console=ttyS0 loglevel=5\u0026#34; \\  -enable-kvm \\  -nic user,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 Here\u0026rsquo;s a brief explanation of each flags:\n -hda is to use a file as a hard disk. -hda is equivalent to sda partition, -hdb is equivalent to sdb, and so on. -m is RAM size for the virtual machine. -nographic make QEMU run on the terminal instead of graphical window. -kernel is to define the custom kernel we\u0026rsquo;ll use in virtual machine. -append is to define kernel parameters we\u0026rsquo;ll be using. We can\u0026rsquo;t use this without -kernel flag. For more info about kernel parameters, we can take a look the kernel docs . -enable-kvm is to enable KVM virtualization support (if available). -nic is to forward internet connection of host machine to virtual machine.  To exit the virtual machine in nographic mode, we can use ctrl-a x.\nAnother Linux Distro as Host System If we use another linux distro, we need to install arch linux in virtual machine from scratch. You can take a look at my previous post for how to install arch linux using QEMU. Please keep in mind that you need to install qemu and vncviewer package on your host system.\nUse Custom Linux Kernel on QEMU VM After installing arch linux in virtual machine, we need to compile the linux kernel based on the kernel config in the virtual machine.\nWe can run the virtual machine with shared directory with this command:\n# @host qemu-system-x86_64 \\  -m 2g \\  -enable-kvm \\  -fsdev local,id=fs1,path=/path/to/linux-kernel,security_model=none \\  -device virtio-9p-pci,fsdev=fs1,mount_tag=shared_directory \\  -nic user,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 \\  \u0026lt;qemu-image\u0026gt; For example:\n# @host qemu-system-x86_64 \\  -m 2g \\  -enable-kvm \\  -fsdev local,id=fs1,path=$HOME/.local/state/qemu/linux-6.14,security_model=none \\  -device virtio-9p-pci,fsdev=fs1,mount_tag=shared_directory \\  -nic user,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 \\  arch-linux-img  Please don\u0026rsquo;t forget to add the shared directory in /etc/fstab.\n In the example above, we\u0026rsquo;re using the linux kernel source code directory as a shared directory.\nInside the virtual machine, we need to copy the kernel config into the shared directory. Assuming our shared directory is in /home/user/shared, we can use this command:\n# @guest zcat /proc/config.gz \u0026gt; /home/user/shared/.config After we got the config, we need to adjust the config so that we only compile linux kernel with the module we need rather than compiling with all module enabled. This can save time to compile the linux kernel. To do that we can use this command:\n# @guest make localmodconfig Sometimes, there are new features or new config parameters in the source code repo and we need to confirm if we want to add those new config parameters in our .config file or not. To reduce the amount of confirmation we need to make, we can use this command:\n# @guest make olddefconfig Also, we need to add a config for virtual machine with this command:\n# @guest make kvm_guest.config If we want to edit some config parameters, we can use:\n# @guest make nconfig After that, we can shutdown the virtual machine and compile the linux kernel with this command:\n# @host make -j \u0026lt;n\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;n\u0026gt; is how much threads we use. For example, make -j 8 means we use 8 threads.\n And then, we need to compile the linux kernel modules with this command:\n# @host make modules After we compile both linux kernel and the modules, we can turn on the virtual machine again and put the modules into /lib/modules/\u0026lt;kernel-name\u0026gt; in the virtual machine with this command:\n# @guest sudo make modules_install And then, we need to copy the linux kernel into /boot with this command:\n# @guest sudo cp /home/user/shared/arch/x86/boot/bzImage /boot/vmlinuz-\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;  We can use any \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; we want, but to make it easier to organize, i suggest you use the same \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; in the following step.\n After that, we need to copy the default mkinitcpio preset like this:\n# @guest sudo cp /etc/mkinitcpio.d/linux.preset /etc/mkinitcpio.d/linux-\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;.preset And then, we need to replace ALL_kver, default_image, and fallback_image with the \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; we assign before. For example, let\u0026rsquo;s say we use torvalds-vm as \u0026lt;name\u0026gt;, we can use something like this:\n... ALL_kver=\u0026quot;/boot/vmlinuz-torvalds-vm\u0026quot; ... default_image=\u0026quot;/boot/initramfs-torvalds-vm.img\u0026quot; ... fallback_image=\u0026quot;/boot/initramfs-torvalds-vm-fallback.img\u0026quot; After that, we need to generate initramfs using this command:\n# @guest sudo mkinitcpio -p linux-\u0026lt;name\u0026gt; Assuming we\u0026rsquo;re using grub as our bootloader in a virtual machine, we need to update the grub config like this:\n# @guest sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg Now, we need to reboot the virtual machine and check if everything works fine. If we check on grub \u0026ldquo;Advanced options for Arch Linux\u0026rdquo;, we should we able to see our custom linux kernel.\nAlright, that\u0026rsquo;s it. See you next time!\nReferences  Create an ArchLinux image for kernel testing  FLUSP Kernel Compilation and Installation   "},{"ref":"https://bruhtus.github.io/posts/install-arch-linux-on-virtual-machine/","title":"Install Arch Linux on Virtual Machine","section":"posts","tags":["Linux"],"date":"2025.03.02","body":"A Brief Intro In this post, we\u0026rsquo;ll install arch linux on virtual machine with QEMU and add a shared directory between host machine and virtual machine.\nBefore we start, make sure to install QEMU on your system. If your system using arch linux too, we can install qemu-base and tigervnc package. tigervnc package for viewing the virtual machine from QEMU. We will be using SeaBIOS, which is legacy BIOS implementation and the default BIOS on QEMU (at the time of writing this post).\nThis post assume that you use ext4 filesystem format. If you use another file format, like btrfs, you might need to use different configuration.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to work with 2 systems on 1 machine, so we need to know which command need to run on which machine. For that purpose, we\u0026rsquo;re going to use this indicator to differentiate:\n# @host # for real machine system # @guest # for virtual machine system QEMU Disk Image The first thing we need to do is to create a disk image. We can do that with this command:\n# @host qemu-img create -f qcow2 \u0026lt;image-path\u0026gt; 15g  qcow2 is the current QEMU image format, and one of the benefit of it is that it will increase the image size based on the virtual machine usage with the limit being the image size given when creating the image. \u0026lt;image-path\u0026gt; is where we store the image. For example: ~/arch-linux-qemu. 15g is the image size.  Installation The first thing we need to do is download the arch linux ISO on the download page .\nAfter that, we can use this command:\n# @host qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -cdrom \u0026lt;path-to-arch-linux-ISO\u0026gt;.iso -boot order=d -drive file=\u0026lt;image-path\u0026gt; -m 2g  -enable-kvm is to enable full virtualization using KVM. Our machine might not support KVM, so make sure we have KVM support when using this flag. We can read the arch wiki for the instruction. -cdrom \u0026lt;path-to-arch-linux-ISO\u0026gt;.iso is to use the file as CD-ROM image. -boot order=d is to specify that we want to boot from CD-ROM first. -drive file=\u0026lt;image-path\u0026gt; is to specify the disk image to use as the drive on the system. Image path should be a full path like $HOME/arch-linux-img -m 2g is to specify the RAM to use in the virtual machine.  Mostly we can follow the arch linux installation guide , but be careful of the partition. Because we will use the default QEMU BIOS, which is a legacy BIOS, we need to partition the drive with legacy BIOS in mind. We can check on the partition example layout on arch wiki . For this post, we\u0026rsquo;ll use BIOS/GPT layout to not deviate too much from the UEFI/GPT layout.\nIf after running the command above, the virtual machine is not automatically appear, we can use command:\n# @host vncviewer :\u0026lt;port\u0026gt; Make sure to install tigervnc or something similar before running the command. We can get the port from the QEMU command above. For example:\n# @host VNC server running on ::1:5900 5900 is the port we want.\nAfter inside the virtual machine, you can follow the usual arch linux installation guide. To be able to use host machine internet connection, we might want to install dhcpcd in the pacstrap step, like this:\n# @guest pacstrap -K /mnt base linux linux-firmware dhcpcd and enable it after arch-chroot like this:\n# @guest systemctl enable dhcpcd The important part is the drive partition, so we\u0026rsquo;ll skip into the partition part.\nPersonally, i don\u0026rsquo;t really need swap on my virtual machine so in this post we\u0026rsquo;ll only make 2 partition:\n BIOS boot partition (1 MB) with partition type BIOS boot. root partition (the rest of storage) with partition type linux root (x86-64).  We can use cfdisk /dev/\u0026lt;drive\u0026gt; to partition our drive. To look what our drive name is, we can use lsblk command. For example:\n# @guest cfdisk /dev/sda After the partition, we need to format the root partition to ext4 with this command:\n# @guest mkfs.ext4 /dev/\u0026lt;root-partition\u0026gt; for example:\n# @guest mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2 After that, we can mount the root partition with this command:\n# @guest mount /dev/\u0026lt;root-partition\u0026gt; /mnt for example:\n# @guest mount /dev/sda2 /mnt After that we can follow the rest of the arch linux installation guide until we need to install the bootloader.\nFor this post, we\u0026rsquo;ll use grub2 as our bootloader. First, we need to install grub with this command (after running arch-chroot):\n# @guest pacman -S grub After grub installed, we can use this command to install the bootloader:\n# @guest grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/\u0026lt;drive-name\u0026gt; keep in mind that we need to provide the drive name, not the partition name. For example:\n# @guest grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/sda After that, we need to generate the grub config with this command:\n# @guest grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg To run the virtual machine, we can use this command:\n# @host qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -nic user,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 -m 2g -smp cores=4,cpus=4 \u0026lt;image-path\u0026gt; If we want to add shared directory between virtual machine and host machine, we can use -fsdev and -device like this:\n# @host qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -nic user,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 -fsdev local,id=fs1,path=\u0026lt;host-shared-directory-path\u0026gt;,security_model=none -device virtio-9p-pci,fsdev=fs1,mount_tag=\u0026lt;mount_tag\u0026gt; -m 2g -smp cores=4,cpus=4 \u0026lt;image-path\u0026gt; and then add to /etc/fstab like this:\n... \u0026lt;mount_tag\u0026gt; \u0026lt;mounting-path-on-virtual-machine\u0026gt; 9p uid=xxxx,gid=xxxx,trans=virtio 0 0 Let\u0026rsquo;s say we have \u0026lt;mount_tag\u0026gt; as shared_directory and we want to mount it on /home/user/shared. Also, to get the uid and gid we can use id \u0026lt;user\u0026gt;, for example id bruhtus. Let\u0026rsquo;s assume the uid and gid of the user is 1000. We can use the command like this:\n# @host qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -nic user,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 -fsdev local,id=fs1,path=\u0026lt;host-shared-directory-path\u0026gt;,security_model=none -device virtio-9p-pci,fsdev=fs1,mount_tag=shared_directory -m 2g -smp cores=4,cpus=4 \u0026lt;image-path\u0026gt; and in /etc/fstab like this:\nshared_directory /home/user/shared 9p uid=1000,gid=1000,trans=virtio 0 0 Alright, that\u0026rsquo;s it. See you next time!\nSide Note If we want to use shutdown or reboot command from non-root user, we can install polkit package, like this:\n# @guest pacman -S polkit We can also ssh into the virtual machine from host machine. First we need to install openssh on virtual machine and host machine, don\u0026rsquo;t forget to start sshd service. And then, we create ssh key with this command:\n# @host ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/qemu (we can change the name qemu with something else).\nAfter that, we can use this command to copy the ssh key into the virtual machine:\n# @host ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/qemu.pub -p 2222 $USER@127.0.0.1 please keep in mind that we need to have the same username on the host machine and virtual machine.

The purpose of backing up dotfiles is so that we don\u0026rsquo;t need to reconfigure our tools on a new system.\nThere are a lot of ways to backup and manage dotfiles, and one of them is using git.\nIn this article we will explore how to backup and manage dotfiles using git, the full working git repository rather than the bare one which a lot of people using.\nHow? What i like to do on my free time is browsing random stuff on internet without a goal, just mindlessly browsing some topic that i\u0026rsquo;m interested in and see if i could find something interesting. Letting your mind wondering, some people said.\nWhile i\u0026rsquo;m browsing on the internet about zsh, i found this github issue discussion about managing dotifles . And when i read through those discussions, i wonder if i can use the full working git repository, which basically the default git repository, rather than the bare one. So let\u0026rsquo;s try that, i guess.\nBack when i first trying to backup my dotfiles, i only know two method:\n Using git bare repository from atlassian article . Using GNU stow which i forgot where i learn that from.  The method i pick for my first dotfiles manager was git bare repository. The reason i go with git bare repository instead of GNU stow is that i don\u0026rsquo;t really want to mindlessly spend my inodes by creating a bunch of symlinks. I have experience with running out of inodes, which basically means that you have some storage left but you cannot create a new file. I know that linux or maybe unix-like system these day has quite a large number of inodes, but that does not mean i need to be wasteful of inodes, right?\nWhat bugging me for quite a while when using git bare repository to manage my dotfiles is that, do i really need to use the bare version of git repository to manage my dotfiles? And just recently i found that the answer is no.\nSo, how do we use the full git working directory, the default one instead of the bare one? It turns out that we can separate the git directory (the .git directory) and the working directory without using the bare repository!\nPlease keep in mind that my experience with git at the time is less than 6 months, maybe around 3 months. So it took me everything i got to just following the git bare dotfiles manager guide. Now, fast forward 2 years later, i made my own dotfiles manager using git. You can check them on my dotfiles repo here .\nThe key point of using git working repository instead of bare repository is this:\ngit --git-dir=\u0026#34;...\u0026#34; --work-tree=\u0026#34;...\u0026#34; init What the command above do is initialize git repository with the specified git directory and working directory. If we didn\u0026rsquo;t specified the working directory but specified the git directory, git will create the bare repository instead of working repository. The key part of this method is --git-dir=\u0026quot;...\u0026quot; --work-tree=\u0026quot;...\u0026quot;, so you might want to create an alias like this:\nalias config=\u0026#39;git --git-dir=\u0026#34;...\u0026#34; --work-tree=\u0026#34;...\u0026#34;\u0026#39; Now you might be wondering, why should we use working repository instead of bare repository? It\u0026rsquo;s because we will most likely change our dotfiles, which basically means we\u0026rsquo;re still \u0026ldquo;working\u0026rdquo; on the dotfiles. So it make more sense to use working repository instead of bare repository because we\u0026rsquo;re still changing something to repository. From what i know, git bare repository is good for sharing and backup files that we don\u0026rsquo;t really change. For example, let\u0026rsquo;s say you are afraid that github will suspend your account and you don\u0026rsquo;t have any backup for your private repository, so you basically lost your private repository. With git bare repository, you can setup a system that only save the git objects of the repo (the one inside .git directory) and update it regularly by pulling from the remote repository. And because you only save the git objects instead of the actual files, your storage usage is lower than storing the actual files. As far as i know, that\u0026rsquo;s the benefit of git bare repository. With that in mind, it\u0026rsquo;s make more sense to use a working repository instead of bare repository in this case.\nThere are 3 important step when we want to get the existing dotfiles on a new system:\n Initialize new git repo. Doing git reset, the default or --mixed one. Doing git checkout.  We already talking about the initialize part for a bit before, which basically just the usual git init. Now let\u0026rsquo;s talk about the git reset part. git reset or git reset --mixed is basically reset the index or staging area on current branch with specific commit. That means, if we don\u0026rsquo;t have any commit on current branch, git reset or git reset --mixed will fill up our index or staging area with commit we specify. Now after we fill up our index or staging area with specific commit, we can generate all or specific files with git checkout -- \u0026lt;path\u0026gt;.\nHonestly the most interesting part is the git checkout part. With git checkout, we can do full dotfiles init or partial init. What i mean by partial init is that when we don\u0026rsquo;t need all the files on the new system, let\u0026rsquo;s say we only our vim config, we can just do git checkout -- ~/.vim and git will only generate the .vim directory with all of the files in it. The benefit of that, is we can put all our config in one git repository and still able to only generate the files we need rather than all the files in the git repository. To initialize all the files in our dotfiles repository, we can do git checkout -- ~.\nSo, to sum up the 3 important command for this to work is:\ngit --git-dir=\u0026#34;...\u0026#34; --work-tree=\u0026#34;...\u0026#34; init git --git-dir=\u0026#34;...\u0026#34; --work-tree=\u0026#34;...\u0026#34; reset git --git-dir=\u0026#34;...\u0026#34; --work-tree=\u0026#34;...\u0026#34; checkout -- \u0026lt;path\u0026gt; Alright, that\u0026rsquo;s it for this article. I will let you explore the implementation and the possibilities of this method yourself. See you next time!\nReferences  Romkatv\u0026rsquo;s bootstrap dotfiles  List of dotfiles manager .

And when you want to take down all those docker container from the docker-compose.yml, you already delete the file?\nIf that\u0026rsquo;s the case, then this post might be for you.\nBefore we start, we will be using docker compose version 2.16.0 in this post. If you are using the older version of docker compose, then this method might not work. Please keep that in mind.\nCheck Docker Compose Project Name The first thing we need to do is to check the project name. We can do that with command:\ndocker-compose ls or if we use docker compose v2, we can use this command instead:\ndocker compose ls If the container already stopped, we can use flags -a or --all like this:\ndocker-compose ls -a or this:\ndocker compose ls -a By default, docker compose will use the docker-compose.yml directory name as project name. We can specify the project name with flag -p or --project-name like this:\ndocker-compose -p anu up -d or this:\ndocker compose -p anu up -d Please keep in mind that we need to use the flags -p or --project-name before the command such as up or down.\nTake Down Docker Compose Component After we know the project name, we can take down all docker component when we spin up the docker container from docker-compose.yml. The component in here means volume, network, or anything that we define inside docker-compose.yml.\nTo take down component from docker compose without the docker-compose.yml, we can use this command:\ndocker-compose -p project-name down \u0026lt;docker-compose-down-flags\u0026gt; or this:\ndocker compose -p project-name down \u0026lt;docker-compose-down-flags\u0026gt; For example, let\u0026rsquo;s say we want to take down docker component from project anu and also remove the volume from those project. We can do that with this command:\ndocker-compose -p anu down -v or this:\ndocker compose -p anu down -v Alright, that\u0026rsquo;s it!\nI am not sure since when the ls command appear in docker compose, so just to be safe i recommend using at least docker compose version 2.16.0.\nSide Note I\u0026rsquo;ve tried this method with docker compose version 1.18.0, but failed. After i downloaded the docker compose binary version 2.16.0 from github, i can use this method.\nStill not sure what was wrong. When i use command docker-compose --help, the flag -p in there. But when i actually spin up a new docker instance with command:\ndocker-compose -p project-name up -d service-name and then tried to take it down with command:\ndocker-compose -p project-name down -v i got an error docker-compose.yml not found or along those lines.\nIf someone know what\u0026rsquo;s going on, please let me know!\n"},{"ref":"https://bruhtus.github.io/posts/simple-guide-qmk-flashing-cli/","title":"Simple Guide Flashing Mechanical Keyboard with QMK CLI","section":"posts","tags":["Notes","Linux"],"date":"2023.02.26","body":"A Brief Intro So recently, around the time i wrote this post, i need to flash my mechanical keyboard. The harsh thing is that, the GUI QMK toolbox only available on windows and macOS, meanwhile i use linux.\nSo, i need to use the QMK CLI to flash my mechanical keyboard. This post is some kind of notes for my future self.\n\u0026ldquo;Humans live by forgetting\u0026rdquo;, some people said. Without further ado, let\u0026rsquo;s get started!\nInstall QMK Firmware First thing first, we need to check if QMK firmware already installed on our system. We can do that with the command below:\ncommand -v qmk If the output is empty, then we need to install QMK firmware first. If the output is not empty, we can skip this process.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a newbie guide on how to install QMK firmware on linux, we can them out here .\nThere are a few options to install QMK firmware on linux. We can install QMK firmware with our linux distro package manager or from python pip.\nIn this post, we will use python pipx to install QMK firmware. We can install QMK firmware from python pipx with this command:\npipx install qmk  Make sure you already have pipx installed on your machine.\n Follow the instruction from the installation process, including installing dependencies on your system and copy the 50-qmk.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d/.\n Copying the 50-qmk.rules make QMK can detect the bootloader of our mechanical keyboard. If we didn\u0026rsquo;t do that, even if our mechanical keyboard already in bootloader mode, QMK won\u0026rsquo;t be able to detect our mechanical keyboard.\n After we install QMK firmware, we need to setup the QMK CLI. We can do that with this command:\nqmk setup By default, the installation directory will be on our home directory. Personally i don\u0026rsquo;t really want to put the QMK installation on my home directory, so i added -H flag to move the installation directory to somewhere else, like this:\nqmk setup -H all-repos/qmk_firmware If the setup already finished, try running:\nqmk doctor and see if there\u0026rsquo;s any issue with the installation.\nFlashing with QMK CLI There\u0026rsquo;s a newbie guide on how to flash our mechanical keyboard using QMK CLI, we can find it here .\nThe point is, we need to know if our mechanical keyboard supported by QMK. We can check the supported mechanical keyboard here .\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say our mechanical keyboard is dz60rgb with ansi layout version 1, we can flash our mechanical keyboard with this command:\nqmk flash -kb dztech/dz60rgb_ansi/v1 -km default  For more info about the flags, we can use qmk flash --help.\n Unfortunately, my current mechanical keyboard is not supported, which is synthesis60 version 2. I need to get the hex file from the mechanical keyboard designer (and fortunately he\u0026rsquo;s within reach).\n In case you also need the synthesis60 version 2 hex file, you can check it here .\n So, to use our own hex file rather than using the default that QMK supported, we can use this command:\nqmk flash \u0026lt;path-to-hex-file\u0026gt; Here\u0026rsquo;s an example:\nqmk flash ~/downloads/dyz_synthesis60_atmega_vial.hex All right, that\u0026rsquo;s it from me.

We can even use it with interactive interface. To invoke the interactive interface, we can use this command:\ngit clean -i . What that command does is prompt us an interactive interface with all the untracked file in current directory.\nTo make it start from the root of git repository, we can use this command:\ngit clean -i $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel) The git rev-parse --show-toplevel will get us the path of current git repository root. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know what i mean by git repository root, we can think of it as the directory or path that has .git directory.\nBut, the clean command has a downside. The clean command does not let us select specific file under untracked directory. It will only let us delete the entire untracked directory with all the file in it.\nTo get around this issue, we can make a shell alias like this:\nalias gurm=\u0026#39;git ls-files --others --exclude-standard | fzf --multi | xargs -r rm -v\u0026#39;  You can change gurm to anything you want.\n The dependencies from shell alias above are:\n git fzf xargs  git ls-files --others --exclude-standard will list all the untracked file and also exclude the file from .gitignore.\nfzf is a fuzzy finder to select the untracked file we want to remove, we also give flags --multi so that we can select multiple file with tab key.\nFinally, we execute rm command with xargs -r. What xargs -r do is make sure that we have some input from standard input (stdin), if there is no input from stdin, xargs will not execute the command. It is useful to prevent an error from a command that require an argument.\nAlright, that\u0026rsquo;s all.

And i was surprised that the interactive selection from git add -p immediately terminated before i can even press any key. Let\u0026rsquo;s get started, shall we?\nFirst Attempt My first attempt to make that shell alias was something like this:\nalias gap=\u0026#39;git status -s | awk \u0026#34;{print \\$2}\u0026#34; | fzf | xargs -r git add -p\u0026#39; Let me briefly explain one by one the command that i use in my shell alias:\n  git status -s -\u0026gt; The short format of git status, without unnecessary info (at least for me).\n  awk \u0026quot;{print \\$2}\u0026quot; -\u0026gt; Only use the second column. The backslash is to prevent shell to expand $2 into a second argument instead of a second column in awk.\n  fzf -\u0026gt; Fuzzy finder by Junegunn1.\n  xargs -r -\u0026gt; Do not run the command if there\u0026rsquo;s no standard input.\n  git add -p -\u0026gt; To add a chunk of changes, only works if the file already tracked by git.\n  This alias is where the problem arise. After i select the file name using fzf, the interactive interface of git add -p only appear for a few seconds and then terminated.\nAccording to stackoverflow answer2:\n Without further arguments xargs does not work with interactive (command line) applications.\nThe reason for that is, by default xargs gets its input from stdin but interactive applications also expect input from stdin.\nTo prevent the applications from grabbing input that is intended for xargs, xargs redirects stdin from /dev/null for the applications it runs.\nThis leads to the application just receiving an EOF3.\n With that in mind, we need to use --arg-file=\u0026lt;file\u0026gt; or -a \u0026lt;file\u0026gt; flag, which means that xargs will read from a \u0026lt;file\u0026gt; instead of stdin ( standard input) so that the stdin remains unchanged. Alright, let\u0026rsquo;s go to the second attempt.\nSecond Attempt Following the stackoverflow answer2, my second attempt was something like this:\nalias gap=\u0026#39;xargs -a \u0026lt;(git status -s | awk \u0026#34;{print \\$2}\u0026#34; | fzf) git add -p\u0026#39; The expression \u0026lt;(git status -s | awk \u0026quot;{print \\$2}\u0026quot; | fzf) is what we called process substitution (or to be precise, shell process substitution).\nInstead of using a file, we use a command to act like a temporary file.\nNow, the problem is, in my experiment i can\u0026rsquo;t use fzf with the shell process substitution because shell process substitution produces a special file that can only be opened and read, but not written or seeked4.\nCommands that treat their arguments as pure streams will works with shell process substitution, but the commands that seek a file they are given (or write to a file) won\u0026rsquo;t work4.\nAnd that is why we can\u0026rsquo;t use interactive command such as fzf with shell process substitution.\nConclusion With all the information from my experiment before, i decided to remove fzf from the alias, which result with this alias:\nalias gap=\u0026#39;xargs -a \u0026lt;(git status -s | awk \u0026#34;{print \\$2}\u0026#34;) git add -p\u0026#39; Is it fulfilling what i need? Not really, i might replace that with shell function instead of shell alias soon. But, i learn something new about shell process substitution.\nExtra Note For more info about the xargs and git flags, check the manpage. For example: man xargs or man git-add.\nIf we use echo with shell process substitution like this:\necho \u0026lt;(git status -s) That will show us where the temporary file created.\n  Fuzzy finder by Junegunn .\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Stackoverflow: xargs explanation .\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Triggering EOF explanation .\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Process substitution result in special file .\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "},{"ref":"https://bruhtus.github.io/posts/replacement-for-info-command/","title":"Replacement For Info Command","section":"posts","tags":["Notes","Linux","Shell"],"date":"2022.06.11","body":"A Brief Intro Sometime ago, someone posted a tweet about a replacement for rm -rf $HOME/directory that is mv $HOME/directory /dev/null.

You can install both of them using your distro package manager or something similar (there are a lot of tutorial on how to install SSH or SSHFS).\nA Brief Intro to SSH According to wikipedia , Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. Typical applications include remote command-line login and remote command execution, but any network service can be secured with SSH.\nTo make it simple, SSH let you access another computer/server and you can use command line interface (CLI) to interact with those computer/server.\nA Brief Intro to SSHFS According to the project github repo , SSHFS allows you to mount a remote filesystem using SFTP.\nTo make it simple, SSHFS let you mount the computer/server storage to your local system and you can treat it like the usual storage on your local system, like using mv and cp command.\nAccess Google Colab Using SSH First thing first, you need to have ngrok account. If you doesn\u0026rsquo;t have ngrok account, then you can register here .\nAfter that, you need to make a new google colab notebook. And then, paste the code below:\n#CODE #Generate root password import random, string password = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;.join(random.choice(string.ascii_letters + string.digits) for i in range(20)) #Download ngrok ! wget -q -c -nc https://bin.equinox.io/c/4VmDzA7iaHb/ngrok-stable-linux-amd64.zip ! unzip -qq -n ngrok-stable-linux-amd64.zip #Setup sshd ! apt-get install -qq -o=Dpkg::Use-Pty=0 openssh-server pwgen \u0026gt; /dev/null #Set root password ! echo root:$password | chpasswd ! mkdir -p /var/run/sshd ! echo \u0026#34;PermitRootLogin yes\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /etc/ssh/sshd_config ! echo \u0026#34;PasswordAuthentication yes\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /etc/ssh/sshd_config ! echo \u0026#34;LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib64-nvidia\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /root/.bashrc ! echo \u0026#34;export LD_LIBRARY_PATH\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /root/.bashrc #Run sshd get_ipython().system_raw(\u0026#39;/usr/sbin/sshd -D \u0026amp;\u0026#39;) #Ask token print(\u0026#34;Copy authtoken from https://dashboard.ngrok.com/auth\u0026#34;) import getpass authtoken = getpass.getpass() #Create tunnel get_ipython().system_raw(\u0026#39;./ngrok authtoken $authtoken \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ./ngrok tcp 22 \u0026amp;\u0026#39;) #Print root password print(\u0026#34;Root password: {}\u0026#34;.format(password)) #Get public address ! curl -s http://localhost:4040/api/tunnels | python3 -c \\ \t\u0026#34;import sys, json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)[\u0026#39;tunnels\u0026#39;][0][\u0026#39;public_url\u0026#39;])\u0026#34; What that code does is basically create a connection from google colab back-end with ngrok so that we can access the google colab back-end using SSH and SSHFS. You can check the github gist for more detail.\nAfter that, you can decide whether to mount your google drive to google colab to or not. If you decide to mount your google drive to google colab, then later on you can mount your google drive using SSHFS.\nAfter you setup all of that, run the code. After you run the code, it gonna request you to copy your ngrok authtoken from ngrok dashboard . If there\u0026rsquo;s an error after you input ngrok authtoken, you can just re-run the code.\nAfter that, you can see the Root password and something similar to tcp://n.tcp.ngrok.io:xxxxx (which n and x represent any number from 0-9)\nNext, you can access the google colab using SSH with the following command:\nssh -p xxxxx root@n.tcp.ngrok.io If there\u0026rsquo;s a question \u0026ldquo;Are you sure you want to continue connecting?\u0026rdquo;, answer yes. That was to save the SSH address so that you can connect to it again in the future. But, if you use google google colab then you need to make new SSH address because each SSH session restart when google colab restart. That is one of the downside for this method.\nAccess Google Drive in Google Colab If you mount google drive before you activate google colab, then you can access google drive too. You can access google drive in google colab using SSHFS.\nIf you can already access google colab back-end using SSH, then all you need too do is to run this command:\nsshfs -p xxxxx root@n.tcp.ngrok.io:/content/drive/MyDrive /mnt/colab The command is almost the same as SSH command from before, the difference is that you need to specify which directory you want to mount on the google colab (in above example is google drive which has path /content/drive/MyDrive) and which directory you want to mount it on the local system (in above example is on /mnt/colab).\nYou can choose to mount google drive on any other directory you want, even on your home directory. I usually mount it on /mnt because it\u0026rsquo;s already a habit of mine to mount an external drive to either /mnt or /run/media. And also, make sure the directory you want to mount your drive into is already exist. I already create colab directory beforehand, so i can mount the google drive into /mnt/colab.\nUpside and Downside There\u0026rsquo;s always an upside and downside of things, and this method is also the same. Below is a few upside and downside that i notice when using this method.\nThe Upside  You can use it like the usual terminal or terminal emulator, with familiar command and vim/neovim in it. If you use SSHFS, you can update your script directly from your terminal emulator to google colab through google drive. Basically you can update your script in google drive directly from your terminal emulator.  The Downside  SSH connection with ngrok only last around 40 minutes, so if you need a long time to run your code then you should use the google colab front-end instead. Use SSH and SSHFS to update script instead of running the script. If you have slow internet connection, then it\u0026rsquo;s gonna be a bit of lag when you interact with google colab back-end CLI. SSH session restart when the google colab restart, and SSH session only last for around 40 minutes so you might need to start over again.  Conclusion When you see that the method has a lot more downside rather than upside, you might be thinking \u0026ldquo;why should i use this method?\u0026rdquo;. Well, only use this method if you feel more comfortable using terminal emulator rather than jupyter notebook, other than that, it\u0026rsquo;s not really worth your time.\nUse this method while it lasts, as far as i know, there was a time when this method doesn\u0026rsquo;t work. At the time of writing this post, this method still works but i\u0026rsquo;m not sure if google gonna let this happen for a long time. Anyway, updating the script through SSHFS is really convenient for me.\nReferences  Google colab SSH github gist . How to SSH into google colab medium post .

All hail HolyC! (R.I.P Terry). Jokes aside, please keep in mind that this guide might become obsolete because the nature of rolling release so you should always check the arch wiki installation guide .\n A Brief Intro I\u0026rsquo;m trying to install an OS as minimal as possible but not from scratch like Linux From Scratch or compiling everything like Gentoo . I might try to install both of them but i don\u0026rsquo;t think i\u0026rsquo;m gonna use one of them as my main OS.\nPre-Installation First thing to do is download the iso from here and make bootable usb drive. After that check if your machine using legacy BIOS or UEFI by doing ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars. If it shows directory without error then the system is booted in UEFI mode, and if the directory doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist then the system may be booted in legacy BIOS (or CSM). Most modern computer usually using UEFI but please check first because it could save you a lot of time during the installation.\nFor this guide, i\u0026rsquo;m installing arch linux on machine with UEFI so i won\u0026rsquo;t cover the legacy BIOS installation here.\nInstallation Here\u0026rsquo;s step-by-step arch linux installation\nLive Environment After booting into live environment, there\u0026rsquo;re a few things you need to do. Below is the things you need to do inside live environment.\nSet Keyboard Layout The default keyboard layout is US so if you want to use US keyboard layout then you can skip this step. You can check available layouts using this command\nls /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/**/*.map.gz and to modify the layout you can use loadkeys. For example, to set a german keyboard layout you can do\nloadkeys de-latin1 Verify The Boot Mode If you already know which one your machine use (legacy BIOS or UEFI), then boot into the right boot mode. You can verify the boot mode by using the same command\nls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars Connect To The Internet At the time of writing this guide, the installation ISO using IWD (Internet Wireless Daemon) to connect to wifi. You can check if you have internet connection or not by doing this\nping google.com #or any website you like such as pornhub.com If there\u0026rsquo;s no internet connection, you can do:\n If you\u0026rsquo;re using ethernet, plug in the cable. If you\u0026rsquo;re using wifi, you can use iwctl (IWD command).  Here\u0026rsquo;s the basic command after you use iwctl (don\u0026rsquo;t forget to press enter to execute the command):\ndevice list #to check the device name station \u0026lt;device-name\u0026gt; scan #to scan the wifi station \u0026lt;device-name\u0026gt; get-networks #to check the available networks station \u0026lt;device-name\u0026gt; connect \u0026lt;wifi-name\u0026gt; #and then enter the password if there\u0026#39;s any exit #exit iwctl After that check again using the ping command.\nUpdate The System Clock After there\u0026rsquo;s an internet connection, you can update the system clock by using\ntimedatectcl set-ntp true to check the service status, use timedatectl status\nPartition The Disks  This is for UEFI, for legacy BIOS please check arch wiki .\n To check the disks that available, you can use lsblk command and pick which disk you want to install arch linux on. The disk start with sd and without a number at the end like sda\nFor the disk partitions, i use cfdisk command. For example, cfdisk /dev/sda (replace sda with the disk you want to use).\n I didn\u0026rsquo;t make swap partition so if you want to make one please refer to arch wiki .\n The first partition is bootloader, usually around 120M and 512M (M means megabytes) depends on what bootloader you want to use. And then change the partition type to EFI System.\nThe second partition is root directory. I use everything that\u0026rsquo;s left but you can spare some for another partition. And then change the partition type to Linux Filesystem.\nAfter you\u0026rsquo;re sure about your disk partitions, then write the changes and then quit.\nFormat The Partitions The next step is format the disk partition. For bootloader partition, format it to FAT32 by using this command\nmkfs.fat -F32 /dev/\u0026lt;efi-system-partition\u0026gt; For root directory, format it to ext4 by using this command\nmkfs.ext4 /dev/\u0026lt;root-partition\u0026gt; For example:\nmkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sda1 mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2 Mount The Filesystems  More info please refer to EFI System Partition Arch Wiki . The next step is mount the partition that we\u0026rsquo;ve made. First, mount root partition to /mnt using this command\n mount /dev/\u0026lt;root-partition\u0026gt; /mnt after that create two directories, /mnt/boot and /mnt/boot/efi (basically create efi directory inside boot directory which both of them doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist so you need to create one by one). You can create both directories using this command\nmkdir -p /mnt/boot mkdir -p /mnt/boot/efi after that mount your bootloader to /mnt/boot/efi using this command\nmount /dev/\u0026lt;efi-system-partition\u0026gt; /mnt/boot/efi For example:\nmount /dev/sda2 /mnt mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot/efi Install Essential Packages You can install essential package by using this command\npacstrap /mnt base base-devel linux linux-firmware vim  /mnt is where you mount your root partition. base is base packages. base-devel is development tool such as sudo and grep. linux is the kernel. linux-firmware is the necessary part of linux kernel. vim is the text editor (i don\u0026rsquo;t even install nano, sorry).  Generate Fstab  Fstab is for telling the kernel what to load in the booting process.\n To generate fstab use this command\ngenfstab -U /mnt \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /mnt/etc/fstab -U means using unique ID instead of human readable ID such as sda. You can check the content of fstab by opening /mnt/etc/fstab file using your text editor (in my case is vim, so i use vim /mnt/etc/fstab).\nChange Root Into New System To take a look inside our new system, we can change root to our new system by using this command\narch-chroot /mnt Configure New System After setup our new system in live environment, now we need to configure our system inside the system (not in live environment anymore) after change root into our new system. There\u0026rsquo;re a few things you need to configure, below is the things you need configure inside new system.\nSet The Time Zone To set the time zone, we can use this command\nln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Region/City /etc/localtime For example:\nln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Jakarta /etc/localtime You can check the region or the city by doing this\nls /usr/share/zoneinfo/Region and\nls /usr/share/zoneinfo/Region/City or just double \u0026lt;tab\u0026gt; while typing ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/\nAfter that, generate the clock using hwclock with this command\nhwclock --systohc Select Your OS Language First, you need to edit etc/locale.gen using your favorite text editor (which is not nano for me) and uncomment the language you want.\nFor example, you want to use US English as your OS language then what you need to uncomment is en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8 and en_US ISO-8859-1.\nAfter that, use this command to generate locales\nlocale-gen and then create the locale.conf file. For example:\nvim /etc/locale.conf #you can replace vim with your favorite text editor the content of locale.conf is\nLANG=en_US.UTF-8 #if you choose US English If you set the keyboard layout (at the beginning of installation), then you make the changes persistent in vconsole.conf. For example:\nvim /etc/vconsole.conf with the content\nKEYMAP=de-latin1 Network Configuration For the network configuration, create the hostname file with the name you want (it\u0026rsquo;s not the user name, it\u0026rsquo;s more like your machine name). For example:\nvim /etc/hostname with the content\nbruhtus After that, add this content to /etc/hosts\n127.0.0.1\tlocalhost ::1\tlocalhost 127.0.1.1\t\u0026lt;yourhostname\u0026gt;.localdomain\t\u0026lt;yourhostname\u0026gt; For example: The previous step i define my hostname as bruhtus, so what i need to do is add this content to /etc/hosts\n127.0.0.1\tlocalhost ::1\tlocalhost 127.0.1.1\tbruhtus.localdomain\tbruhtus  If the system has a permanent IP address, it should be used instead of 127.0.1.1.\n After that, install network manager using this command pacman -S networkmanager wpa_supplicant and then activate on startup using systemctl enable NetworkManager and systemctl enable wpa_supplicant.\nSet The Root Password To set the root (or admin) password, use this command\npasswd and then enter your password.\nAdd New User  The default user is only root (or admin).\n To create new user, use this command\nuseradd -m \u0026lt;username\u0026gt; after that create the password for that username by using this command\npasswd \u0026lt;username\u0026gt; and then enter your password.\nFor example:\nuseradd -m bruhtus #i like my hostname and my username to be the same passwd bruhtus and then enter the password.\nAdd New User To Group  It\u0026rsquo;s so that the new user can have root access using sude\n To add new user to group, we can use this command\nusermod -aG wheel,audio,video,optical,storage \u0026lt;username\u0026gt; Edit Sudoers File  Add the wheel group to have root access with sudo\n Use visudo and look for wheel and then uncomment those line.\nThe line would be like this\n%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL By default, visudo using vi to edit the file. If you didn\u0026rsquo;t want to use vi then you can do\nEDITOR=vim visudo Install Bootloader  In my case, i use grub as the bootloader. So, i\u0026rsquo;m just gonna cover grub installation in this section.\n First, install the bootloader and efibootmgr using this command\npacman -S grub efibootmgr After that, use this command to install grub on system partition\ngrub-install /dev/\u0026lt;disk-partition\u0026gt; For example:\ngrub-install /dev/sda #without any number at the end If there\u0026rsquo;s no error, then generate grub config using this command\ngrub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg  If there\u0026rsquo;s an error, please check here or use search engine. I can\u0026rsquo;t cover every single error.\n Reboot If there\u0026rsquo;s no error, exit from chroot using exit command. After that, unmount the system using umount -R /mnt and then reboot (please make sure the disk partition is priority in bios).\nGraphical User Interface If you only use command line interface, then you don\u0026rsquo;t need to continue. But, if you still need graphical user interface (GUI) to open browser or something like that, then keep going.\nLogin To Your Arch Installation After reboot, login to your user you just created (in my case, it\u0026rsquo;s bruhtus). After that check the internet connection by using ping command (for example: ping google.com). If there\u0026rsquo;s an error then connect to your network using nmtui command. After that check the connection using ping command again. If there\u0026rsquo;s still an error, please check arch wiki or use your search engine.\nInstall And Configure Graphical Environment Install a few package using this command\nsudo pacman -S xorg xorg-init alacritty lightdm lightdm-gtk-greeter lightdm-gtk-greeter-settings i3-gaps  xorg and xorg-init is for graphical interface. alacritty is the terminal emulator i choose (you can replace that with your favorite terminal emulator). lightdm, lightdm-gtk-greeter, and lightdmn-gtk-greeter-settings is for login manager (unless you want to start your graphical environment manually like a champ, then you should probably install one). i3-gaps is the window manager i choose (you can replace that with your favorite window manager).   Please keep in mind that i use standalone window manager so i need to install xorg and xorg-init manually, but if you choose desktop environment then i think you don\u0026rsquo;t need to install those two.\n After everything installed, copy the xinitrc using this command\ncp /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc ~/.xinitrc What that command do is copy xinitrc to your home directory. What .xinitrc do is start the window manager or desktop environment you choose (we\u0026rsquo;ll get to that later in this post).\nThe next step is to edit .xinitrc, you can do the following step:\n Remove the last 5 row (from twm \u0026amp; until exec xterm -geometry 80x66+0+0 -name login) And then add exec i3 in the last row (basically replace the last 5 row with this exec i3).   Twm is default xorg window manager, in case you\u0026rsquo;re wondering.\n Please keep in mind that i use i3 window manager so i use exec i3. To makes thing simpler, exec is where you start your window manager or desktop environment so the usual syntax would be like this exec \u0026lt;window-manager\u0026gt;.\nAfter that, enable login manager by using this command:\nsudo sysmtemctl enable lightdm The last step is to check if there\u0026rsquo;s an error or not by using this command startx to start xorg. If everything fine (you can access your window manager or desktop environment) then reboot.\n For intel user, if there\u0026rsquo;s an error while using startx, you can try installing xf86-video-intel first and see if that fix the error or not. If that doesn\u0026rsquo;t fix your error then you know what to do.\n The Conclusion That\u0026rsquo;s all you need to do to install arch linux. After that you can install all the program you want. I suggest you to try it first inside virtual machine such as virtualbox, virt-manager or something else.\nReferences  Arch wiki installation guide . Arch wiki grub installation .

"},{"ref":"https://bruhtus.github.io/posts/linux-ownership-permissions/","title":"Linux Ownership and Permissions","section":"posts","tags":["Linux"],"date":"2021.02.06","body":" How to change ownership and permission on linux (and probably other unix-like system? i\u0026rsquo;m not sure). Plain boring and important.\n A Brief Intro File/directory ownership is basically who owns the file/directory, for example, if we create a file/directory as admin or root in this case and if we want to edit those file/directory as user then we need to change the file/directory ownership because that file/directory owned by the root and we have no access to change that file/directory.\nTo check the ownership and permission you can use ls -l, to make it simpler, -l means long format and the file ownership on column 3 (username) or 4 (group). Below is the example output when you run ls -l command:\nAs you can see from example above, most of the files owned by bruhtus user and only one file owned by root (the admin) so if we want to change that file then we need to change the ownership or access root privilege everytime we want to change that file (which is such a pain). Your choice.\nThere\u0026rsquo;re 10 character on the most left side or the first column of the ls -l result, let\u0026rsquo;s take a look on nganu file as an example. On the most left side of nganu there\u0026rsquo;re this squence -rw-r--r--. The - means that there\u0026rsquo;s no permission for that file or directory, or if it on the most left then it means it\u0026rsquo;s not directory (or folder). So if nganu is directory rather than a file then the squence gonna be like this drwxr-xr-x.\nr means that the file or directory has read permission (we can take a look at it), w means that the file or directory has write permission (we can edit the file), and lastly is x which means that the file or directory is executable (we can run the file). Usually if we make a folder then it\u0026rsquo;s already have executable permission.\nHow To Change Ownership Change ownership is quite simple, the format is like this\nchown user:group \u0026lt;file\u0026gt; if you want to change ownership from or to root (or admin) then you need to access root privilege. Take the example from the image above, if i want to change ownership of file nganu from root to bruhtus user, then what i need to do is\nsudo chown bruhtus:bruhtus nganu Please keep in mind that the user is on column three and the group is on column four on ls -l result if you\u0026rsquo;re unsure about the user and the group. chown command is not only for file but also for directory (or folder).\nIf you want to change all the files within the directory (not only the directory itself), then you can do\nchown -R user:group \u0026lt;directory\u0026gt; For example, let\u0026rsquo;s assume that nganu is a directory with a file anu and owned by root like this\nIf we want to change ownership of the nganu directory and anu file from root to bruhtus user, then what we need to do is\nsudo chown -R bruhtus:bruhtus nganu Please keep in mind that we need sudo because the previous owner is root (or admin), if the previous owner isn\u0026rsquo;t root then we don\u0026rsquo;t need sudo.\nHow To Change Permission The permission section has 10 character like i explained above, here\u0026rsquo;s the breakdown of those permission:\n   Directory Owner Group Others     d or - rwx or --- rwx or --- rwx or ---     r or read is worth 4 points w or write is worth 2 points x or executable is worth 1 points  So if you have read, write, and execute permission of the owner, group, and others then it\u0026rsquo;s gonna be 777. Here\u0026rsquo;s the example:\nfile anu only has read and write permission for the owner, and only read permission for group and others (or everyone else), in this case it\u0026rsquo;s worth 644. Why is this important? because we can use that to change file or directory permission precisely.\nSo if you want to change anyfile to have the same arrangement as file anu then you can do\nchmod 644 \u0026lt;file\u0026gt; if we want to change those file to have execute permission on owner, group, and others then we can do this\nchmod 755 \u0026lt;file\u0026gt; or if you want everyone to have the same permission you can use +, like this one (have execute permission on owner, group, and others)\nchmod +x \u0026lt;file\u0026gt; or you want to specify one of them (either owner/user, group, or others) you can do one of this\nchmod u+x \u0026lt;file\u0026gt; #execute permission only for user/owner chmod g+x \u0026lt;file\u0026gt; #execute permission only for group chmod o+x \u0026lt;file\u0026gt; #execute permission only for others chmod ug+x \u0026lt;file\u0026gt; #execute permission only for user/owner and group chmod a+x \u0026lt;file\u0026gt; #similar to +x, give user/owner, group, and others execute permission You can also change permission recursively like change ownership, by doing this\nchmod -R u+x \u0026lt;directory\u0026gt; or\nchmod u+x -R \u0026lt;directory\u0026gt; The Conclusion That\u0026rsquo;s all about changing ownership and permission on linux. Hopefully that\u0026rsquo;s useful (probably not, optimistic).\nReferences  DistroTube Video .  "},{"ref":"https://bruhtus.github.io/posts/python-vs-shell/","title":"Python Script vs. Shell Script: Command Line Use Case","section":"posts","tags":["Linux","Python","Shell"],"date":"2021.01.14","body":" In this post i\u0026rsquo;m comparing performance python script and shell script that i\u0026rsquo;ve made. The script objective is to check git status on every git repo directory.\n Skip-able Part  Just a background story why i made this post\n Have you wondered what performance between python script and shell script (or some people might say bash script) to run command on terminal? no? same, just kidding. I\u0026rsquo;m curious about shell script because i can do command line stuff with python script too which for my past self is easier to read.\nFor around a month, i\u0026rsquo;ve learned shell scripting from youtube (mostly luke smith videos ) and i gotta say that for command line use case, shell script is more efficient than python script. Please keep in mind that i\u0026rsquo;m not an expert when it comes to python scripting or shell scripting, so there might be some performance enhancement that you can make to my script.\nA Brief Intro to Shell Script You might be wondering \u0026ldquo;what is shell script?\u0026rdquo; well, to put it simpler, it\u0026rsquo;s a script that you can run with shell. Shell, like python, is a programming language and that\u0026rsquo;s why you can run for loop in a terminal like a psychopath, just kidding i did that sometimes (maybe i\u0026rsquo;m a pyschopath? 👀).\nThere are quite a few ways to run shell script, here\u0026rsquo;s some that i know:\n  Make script executable by doing chmod +x \u0026lt;script-name\u0026gt; and then run the script by doing ./\u0026lt;script-name\u0026gt; if you\u0026rsquo;re already in the same directory as the script or chmod +x \u0026lt;path-to-script\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;script-name\u0026gt; and then run the script by doing \u0026lt;path-to-script\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;script-name\u0026gt; if you\u0026rsquo;re not in the same directory as the script. For example: If i want to run my git-status-checker script, then what i would do is type chmod +x git-status-checker if i already in the same directory as git-status-checker script and then run the script by typing ./git-status-checker. But, if i\u0026rsquo;m not in the same directory as git-status-checker, let\u0026rsquo;s say i\u0026rsquo;m in Download directory meanwhile the script is in Script directory, then what i would do is type chmod +x ~/script/git-status-checker and then run the script by typing ~/script/git-status-checker.\n  Using sh or bash command. For example: If i want to run my git-status-checker script, then i run the script by typing sh git-status-checker or bash git-status-checker, both command basically do the same thing.\n  The Test In this post, i\u0026rsquo;m gonna test the runtime both python script and shell script that i\u0026rsquo;ve made. The script objective is to check git status in each git repo directory on my machine.\nThe Environment of The Test All my git repo directory is located in all_git directory on home directory, so i only need to focus on that directory which is gonna make the task of the script a little bit easier and faster than check all other directory too.\nThe amount of not staged for commit is the same when running both script, which is around 13 in total. So the performance may decrease as the amount of unstaged increase.\nI\u0026rsquo;m gonna run the in two way, the first test is including git status for git submodules and the second test is excluding git status for git submodules.\nThe Results First Test In the first test, the runtime of python script is around 0.08 - 0.12 seconds and the runtime of shell script is around 0.07 - 0.08 seconds. Here\u0026rsquo;s the example of runtime of both script (which at this time coincidentally the same):\nSecond Test In the second test, the runtime of python script is around 0.05 - 0.07 seconds and the runtime of shell script is around 0.01 - 0.02 seconds. Here\u0026rsquo;s the example of runtime of both script:\nThe Explanation The effect of checking git status in git submodules is quite a lot but still less than a second which gonna make people think \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s not that much of a difference\u0026rdquo;, well, in case you forgot that this script objective is just to check git status on each git repo directory, it\u0026rsquo;s just a simple task. If you\u0026rsquo;re going to make a more complicated task with a lot of command, that\u0026rsquo;s where you\u0026rsquo;re gonna see the gap.\nI\u0026rsquo;m gonna explain the first test source code first, below is the python script for the first test:\nimport os home = \u0026#39;/home/bruhtus/\u0026#39; dir_list = [dirname for dirname in os.listdir(f\u0026#39;{home}/all_git\u0026#39;) if os.path.isdir(f\u0026#39;{home}/all_git/{dirname}\u0026#39;) == True] for dirname in dir_list: path = f\u0026#39;{home}/all_git/{dirname}\u0026#39; os.system(f\u0026#39;echo {path}\u0026#39;) if os.path.exists(f\u0026#39;{path}/.gitmodules\u0026#39;) == True: os.system(f\u0026#39;git -C {path}status -s\u0026#39;) os.system(f\u0026#39;git -C {path}submodule foreach git status -s\u0026#39;) else: os.system(f\u0026#39;git -C {path}status -s\u0026#39;) And below is the shell script for the first test:\n#!/bin/sh  for d in $(ls -d ~/all_git/*/); do echo $d \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git -C $d status -s \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ls -a $d | grep -q .gitmodules \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git -C $d submodule foreach git status -s done Let\u0026rsquo;s take step by step of the processes. The first process is to list all directory in all_git directory, because we already specify that all git repo directory gonna be in all_git directory so we don\u0026rsquo;t need to check if it\u0026rsquo;s a git repo or not (one less task). So, here\u0026rsquo;s a comparison of the python script and shell script:\nThe python part below:\nhome = \u0026#39;/home/bruhtus/\u0026#39; dir_list = [dirname for dirname in os.listdir(f\u0026#39;{home}/all_git\u0026#39;) if os.path.isdir(f\u0026#39;{home}/all_git/{dirname}\u0026#39;) == True] for dirname in dir_list: is equivalent to this part in shell script:\nfor d in $(ls -d ~/all_git/*/); do Both of the script take list of directory in all_git directory and do a for loop to check each folder. You might be able to optimize my python script but i think that the shell script is much simpler than python script. What i mean simpler is less lines of code, not easier to understand. If you need an easier to understand code then python is the way, but it\u0026rsquo;s not really the topic of this post (everyone knows that python script is human readable, right?).\nLet\u0026rsquo;s continue, in the python part below:\npath = f\u0026#39;{home}/all_git/{dirname}\u0026#39; os.system(f\u0026#39;echo {path}\u0026#39;) if os.path.exists(f\u0026#39;{path}/.gitmodules\u0026#39;) == True: os.system(f\u0026#39;git -C {path}status -s\u0026#39;) os.system(f\u0026#39;git -C {path}submodule foreach git status -s\u0026#39;) else: os.system(f\u0026#39;git -C {path}status -s\u0026#39;) is equivalent to this part in shell script:\necho $d \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git -C $d status -s \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ls -a $d | grep -q .gitmodules \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git -C $d submodule foreach git status -s done That second process is to check the git status and git submodules status of all directories. The part where there\u0026rsquo;s echo is basically print out anything that we give, in this case it\u0026rsquo;s gonna print directory name so i\u0026rsquo;m not gonna go into detail for that part.\nNow i\u0026rsquo;m gonna explain a little bit about \u0026amp;\u0026amp; command in shell, it\u0026rsquo;s basically let you run the second command (on the right side) if the first command (on the left side) success. So, it\u0026rsquo;s basically an equivalent of if-else statement in most programming language. The shell script part below:\ngit -C $d status -s \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ls -a $d | grep -q .gitmodules \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git -C $d submodule foreach git status -s is equivalent to this part of python script:\nif os.path.exists(f\u0026#39;{path}/.gitmodules\u0026#39;) == True: os.system(f\u0026#39;git -C {path}status -s\u0026#39;) os.system(f\u0026#39;git -C {path}submodule foreach git status -s\u0026#39;) else: os.system(f\u0026#39;git -C {path}status -s\u0026#39;) The ls -a $d | grep -q .gitmodules is equivalent to if os.path.exists(f'{path}/.gitmodules') == True, both command check if there\u0026rsquo;s a git submodules in the git repo directory or not. So in the second test, i\u0026rsquo;m removing those if-else statement and then run only git status which makes shell script faster than python script.\nThe Conclusion For command line interface stuff, you should probably use shell script instead of python script. I\u0026rsquo;m not saying that python is bad, it\u0026rsquo;s just not the right tool for command line interface stuff. Yeah python can do almost everything but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean python is the best at everything, at least not at command line interface use case which is shell script clearly better here.\nReferences  Luke smith youtube channel .

"},{"ref":"https://bruhtus.github.io/posts/mac-os-linux/","title":"The Difference Between GNU/Linux and Mac OS","section":"posts","tags":["Linux"],"date":"2020.12.29","body":" To make things clear that GNU/Linux and Mac OS is different and don\u0026rsquo;t expect both of them do the same thing.\n Skip-able Part What motivates me to make this post is a tweet from someone named David Bombal that trying to install ubuntu on macbook with M1 chip, here is the tweet .\nThat tweet makes me wonder why would someone install ubuntu on mac, isn\u0026rsquo;t mac os and linux similar? well it turn out they\u0026rsquo;re not similar. In this post i\u0026rsquo;ll try to explain what the difference between mac os and linux.\nA Brief Intro to Kernel and Operating System First thing first, we need to know what kernel and operating system is because we\u0026rsquo;re gonna talk a lot about both of them.\nWhat is kernel? to make things simpler, kernel is a bridge between software and hardware. Kernel allocate the system resources (such as CPU, RAM, and other stuff, basically the hardware) to the program/software that we open.\nWhat is operating system? according to debian post : An operating system consists of various fundamental programs which are needed by your computer so that it can communicate and receive instructions from users; read and write data to hard disks, tapes, and printers; control the use of memory; and run other software. The most important part of an operating system is the kernel.\nThen what\u0026rsquo;s the difference? well, kernel is part of the operating system and kernel alone doesn\u0026rsquo;t form a working operating system. You need another component other than kernel to make a working operating system which is beyond the scope of this post.\nA Brief Intro to GNU/Linux What most people knew as \u0026ldquo;linux\u0026rdquo; operating system is usually GNU/Linux. GNU consist the component for operating system except the kernel and linux fill the gap on GNU system. So linux alone doesn\u0026rsquo;t form a working operating system and GNU system with linux kernel make the whole operating system. You can use something other than GNU system if you want, like alpine linux which use musl libc and busybox instead of GNU. GNU/Linux is a unix-like operating system, what it means is that the operating system behaves in a similar manner to a unix system while not necessarily conforming to or being certified to any unix trademark.\nA Brief Intro to Mac OS Mac OS is Apple Mac line up (macbook, mac pro, etc) operating system and it\u0026rsquo;s based on darwin operating system which is based on BSD operating system. Here\u0026rsquo;s the schema for better understanding what i mean:\nMac OS also use XNU as a kernel. XNU stands for X is Not Unix (from apple\u0026rsquo;s github repo ). So Mac OS based on Darwin and XNU which is already different from GNU/Linux.\nThe Difference So basically mac os was based on BSD system while GNU/Linux was based on GNU system. Other than that, mac os doesn\u0026rsquo;t use linux as it\u0026rsquo;s kernel and use XNU instead. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure the difference between XNU and linux at this point, but i can give one example that is KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) which is built into linux kernel. Basically KVM let you interact with kernel directly instead of using emulation for virtual machine.\nOther than the difference between kernel feature such as KVM, there\u0026rsquo;s a different feature or command from BSD system and GNU system. From this article , if you want to use GNU command, you need to install it first while in GNU/Linux you can use it immediately.\nAlso Mac OS doesn\u0026rsquo;t come with the package manager, as far as i know, you need to install the package manager yourself (i might be wrong tho, i have no mac to test it out), whereas the package manager already installed in GNU/Linux.\nTo make it simpler, the package manager is for installing and uninstalling a program from terminal.\nThe Conclusion Mac OS and GNU/Linux are two different system and don\u0026rsquo;t expect them to behaves the same. If you want Mac OS app then you should buy a mac, but if you want to have access to a lot of terminal or command line interface stuff then you should install GNU/Linux on PC or buy a machine that already came with it.\nInstalling GNU/Linux on mac is not really efficient because you could get a lot more computing power with the same price and mac hardware usually optimized with Mac OS so GNU/Linux might not run as smooth as Mac OS on mac (and mac user gonna judge that GNU/Linux not as good as Mac OS bla bla bla, which is stupid).\nHopefully you didn\u0026rsquo;t confuse Mac OS with GNU/Linux again and choose what you need rather than expecting Mac OS and GNU/Linux to behaves the same (and it seems like a lot of people did that).\nReferences  Why GNU/Linux .

"},{"ref":"https://bruhtus.github.io/posts/manjaro-i3/","title":"Manjaro i3 Edition","section":"posts","tags":["Linux"],"date":"2020.12.22","body":" A minimalist approach to new arch linux user or new linux user in general. No more, maybe less.\n Skip-able Part  Just a background story why i use manjaro i3 edition.\n Have you ever bored with your current desktop environment? because that\u0026rsquo;s what made me wanted to try manjaro i3 edition. Why manjaro i3 edition and not something else like regolith linux? Here\u0026rsquo;s the reason:  I want a rolling release distro because it\u0026rsquo;s kind of a pain to reinstall the whole system just to upgrade to the new version in fixed-point release distro just like regolith linux (because it\u0026rsquo;s based on ubuntu). I want to try new things and fixed-point release is kind of boring for me. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong with fixed-point release distro, it\u0026rsquo;s just not for me.  Now you wondering why manjaro specifically, Ok let me explain. I choose manjaro because a lot of people said that manjaro is more stable than other arch-based linux because the manjaro team hold on the update for a week or two after the update on arch repo. And now arch linux user gonna get mad at me like \u0026ldquo;Arch linux is also stable if you choose the stable mirror bla bla bla\u0026rdquo;, and honestly it\u0026rsquo;s kind of true. The reason i didn\u0026rsquo;t using arch linux is more for long term stuff. What i mean long term is that when i need to reinstall the operating system on my machine or when i got a new device, i want to install the operating system quickly. Especially with new device which have different hardware and configuration and i need to figure it out one by one if i use arch linux, uh that\u0026rsquo;s kind of hard for me at the moment. I might try installing arch linux in the future because i like the philosophy of arch linux that is \u0026ldquo;choose only what you want\u0026rdquo; so you need to know what you want first and you decide what you want. That\u0026rsquo;s like the most \u0026ldquo;freedom\u0026rdquo; i\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen and i\u0026rsquo;m kind of excited to try it out, but for now i\u0026rsquo;m still trying to figure out what i want to install on my machine and manjaro i3 edition is here to help me do that.\nMy Experience In this part i\u0026rsquo;m gonna type it into two part, the good part and the not good part of manjaro i3 edition.\nThe Good Part What makes manjaro i3 edition special is that this installation come with only minimum stuff which is good because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t take up too much space in the fresh installation.\nWhat do you mean by minimum stuff? well, for example in the full fledged desktop environment such as gnome, kde plasma, and xfce, you got system settings with the function to set up wallpaper, lock screen and stuff that you don\u0026rsquo;t even know. In manjaro i3 edition or in standalone window manager desktop environment, you didn\u0026rsquo;t have something like that. If you want something similar then you need to install the program that has the same function to set up wallpaper, lock screen, and other stuff.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s what i mean by minimal, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t come with a lot of stuff that you probably didn\u0026rsquo;t know that it\u0026rsquo;s installed on you system and take up space.\nThe Not Good Part In case you\u0026rsquo;re happy that the fresh installation doesn\u0026rsquo;t take up a lot of space, you might want to hold that for a moment because it has the downside.\nThe downside with minimum stuff installed is that a lot of things doesn\u0026rsquo;t work from the start so you need to install a package or even tweak a bit on the terminal. For example, you need to install pulseaudio before you could use your headphone jack and you need to install pulseaudio-bluetooth if you want to use your bluetooth audio stuff. The installation doesn\u0026rsquo;t come with pulseaudio and it kind of hard to work with only alsa for me, so you need to keep that in mind.\nBut, it\u0026rsquo;s not really a bad thing (that\u0026rsquo;s why i called it \u0026ldquo;not good\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;bad\u0026rdquo;). Why it\u0026rsquo;s not a bad thing? because you learn how to fix stuff and slowly you understand what works and what doesn\u0026rsquo;t work rather than only using what\u0026rsquo;s already there. So there\u0026rsquo;s a learning process there, not as intense as arch linux but it\u0026rsquo;s the first step towards that.\nYou might complain \u0026ldquo;but it\u0026rsquo;s not specific to standalone window manager, we learn something too in full fledged desktop environment\u0026rdquo;, and yeah you might learn something in full fledged desktop environment but what you learn usually tied down to that specific desktop environment rather than the general stuff. I have no problem if i want to change distro from manjaro to arch linux or debian, but if you use a specific desktop environment that come with the linux distro then you might have a hard time because every linux distro has different configuration for their desktop environment. Yeah it\u0026rsquo;s gnome but the configuration and the key bindings doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessary the same with each linux distro, meanwhile when you\u0026rsquo;re using standalone window manager, you can backup you configuration file to github or other git repositories and use it in any linux distro you want (i\u0026rsquo;m not sure if you can do that with full fledged desktop environment).\nConclusion Manjaro i3 edition is a nice warm up for someone who are trying to learn about standalone window manager desktop environment. Learn what package and configuration you want and learn how to fix the problem that doesn\u0026rsquo;t come with the installation package first, and then finally try arch linux.\nIn case you want something more minimal than manjaro i3 edition, you might want to try arcolinux , especially the arcolinuxd iso (it\u0026rsquo;s a combination of arch linux freedom with calamares installer).\nDecember 2020 Setup  Rick Astley ASCII version anyone?\n "},{"ref":"https://bruhtus.github.io/posts/zsh-aliases/","title":"Zsh Aliases: Be Lazy!","section":"posts","tags":["Linux","Shell"],"date":"2020.12.13","body":" Have you ever thought that typing a long command is such a pain? well, here\u0026rsquo;s one of the solution for you.\n Skip-able Part  Just a background story why i write this in the first place.\n At some random time back then i thought \u0026ldquo;can i increase my speed while using the command line interface?\u0026rdquo; and there\u0026rsquo;s two option i could think of back then, the first one is to increase my typing speed and the second one is to make everything i type shorter.\nHonestly i like to take it easy when typing, i\u0026rsquo;m not really those rush type who are trying to type fast. I don\u0026rsquo;t really care about the speed of my typing as long as i\u0026rsquo;m comfortable typing at that speed. It\u0026rsquo;s more like durability rather than speed and that\u0026rsquo;s why i take it easy. So, increasing my typing speed is a no (at least for me).\nThe second option is where piques my interest. From that point i did some research how i can shorten the command i use on internet (google, youtube, and even pornhub but unfortunately no one uploaded on pornhub yet (maybe i should be the one to upload on pornhub? hmm)).\nA Brief Intro to Shell Alias Basically shell alias is a key shortcut for the command that you want to use. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example: If you want to make a new directory, let\u0026rsquo;s say the name of the directory is \u0026ldquo;anu\u0026rdquo;, then if the directory already exist, you want the command doesn\u0026rsquo;t give an error message as a feedback. So here\u0026rsquo;s the command: mkdir -p anu. Everytime you want to make a new directory without an error message if the directory already exist, you need to type mkdir -p \u0026lt;directory-name\u0026gt; and further more if there\u0026rsquo;s a typo while you type it, uh that\u0026rsquo;s such a pain.\nSo, how would you make that simpler? well by using shell alias of course, and in this post i\u0026rsquo;m gonna use Z shell or zsh so the syntax might be different from bash and fish shell. Please keep that in mind.\nType of Zsh Aliases Before we start to how to make a shell aliases or in particular zsh aliases, we need to type the type of aliases that zsh has.\nThere\u0026rsquo;re four type of zsh aliases:\n Simple aliases Suffix aliases Function aliases Global aliases  Simple Aliases Like the name suggest, it\u0026rsquo;s just a simple stuff (or you could say the default?). Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of simple alias: alias md='mkdir -p' From above example, if you want to make a new directory without error message if the directory already exist then you only need to type md rather than mkdir -p. So, it\u0026rsquo;s basically telling the terminal that md equivalent to command mkdir -p and execute mkdir -p command immediately.\nSuffix Aliases Suffix alias is for opening a specific extension in a specific program, it defined using -s flag. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of suffix alias: alias -s py=vim From above example, it\u0026rsquo;s basically telling the terminal to open every extension .py in vim. So if you have a python file, let\u0026rsquo;s say anu.py, then you just need to type anu.py and it\u0026rsquo;s gonna translate to vim anu.py, opening anu.py file in vim.\nPersonally i don\u0026rsquo;t really use this alias because i like to type vim and even if you\u0026rsquo;re too lazy to type vim you could use simple alias instead, like alias v='vim'.\nFunction Aliases Function alias is when you want an input in your command. For example, you want to open a python file and then preview the output using less (you use try it yourself, i won\u0026rsquo;t explain it). Here\u0026rsquo;s the function alias for that scenario: function anu(){ python $@ | less} #the @ symbol is basically saying to take everything after the command as input. So everytime you run a python script with anu then it\u0026rsquo;s output gonna be displayed in less. Let\u0026rsquo;s say you want to open itu.py, then you use anu itu.py and you\u0026rsquo;re gonna see the output inside of less rather than on terminal.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s another example: function nganu(){ python -c $1} #the 1 number is saying to take the first argument as an input, you could add another input by using $2, $3, and so on. If you type nganu 'import numpy as np' in your terminal then you\u0026rsquo;re gonna execute python -c 'import numpy as np'. So it\u0026rsquo;s basically take the first argument which is 'import numpy as np' as an input (please keep in mind that using '' considered as one argument).\nGlobal Aliases Global alias is the command that you could place anywhere in the sequences. For example, you want to grep a specific file in your directory and you probably gonna type ls | grep filename (honestly i don\u0026rsquo;t care what you type, you do you), if you type ls | grep filename every time you want to search for something than it\u0026rsquo;s gonna become a hassle.\nSo, what should you do? well, you could give a global alias to grep like this: alias -g G='| grep'. After that you could place G in the middle of your command, like this: ls G filename | less (it\u0026rsquo;s gonna direct the grep result to less) or in the back of your command, like this: ls G filename (not using less). The G alias is only for | grep command so you still need to type the pattern to search or in this case a filename.\nTips To make some Aliases First, before you make aliases, please check if the command already exist or not using which command. For example: i want to name my alias ls, before i make alias ls, i\u0026rsquo;m need to type which ls to show me if ls already assigned to other program or command. If after you type which \u0026lt;alias-you-want\u0026gt; and there\u0026rsquo;s an error like \u0026lt;alias-you-want\u0026gt; not found then you\u0026rsquo;re ready to go.\nSecond, don\u0026rsquo;t make to much specific simple aliases. For example, you want to make alias to install packages from your package manager, let\u0026rsquo;s say debian package manager (apt), you need to type sudo apt install \u0026lt;package-name\u0026gt;, and you want to make it simple by using alias like alias sai='sudo apt install'. So everytime you want to install something you just need to type sai \u0026lt;package-name\u0026gt;, simple right? well, honestly it\u0026rsquo;s not really a good practice because over time you\u0026rsquo;re gonna forget what the command behind those alias. If you\u0026rsquo;re really forgot what the command then there\u0026rsquo;s which command as a livesaver, but do you really want that? Imagine you\u0026rsquo;re using another machine without your aliases, then you forgot a simple command because you\u0026rsquo;re using to much alias, isn\u0026rsquo;t that kind of sad?\nConclusion Shell alias is like a double edge sword, use it carefully and don\u0026rsquo;t be dependent on it. If possible, only make aliases if you\u0026rsquo;re using it a lot and already know the basic or maybe make aliases that represent the executed command.\nBonus Useful Alias function sd(){cd \u0026quot;$(du ~ | awk '{print $2}' | fzf)\u0026quot;}  That\u0026rsquo;s my first attempt using fzf, it basically change directory using fzf output as an input.\n function cs(){find ~ -type f | fzf | xargs -o -r vim}  That\u0026rsquo;s basically find every files in home directory using find and fzf and then open the file in vim directly (the parameter -o for not broke my terminal after the command (for some reason) and the -r for if there\u0026rsquo;s no input then it\u0026rsquo;s gonna back to terminal instead opening vim. For more detail please check on man page).\n References  Types of zsh aliases . Luke smith youtube channel . Distrotube youtube channel .

It\u0026rsquo;s mostly for linux, i\u0026rsquo;m not sure if you can use it for mac os or windows too.\n Why Should You Backup Your System? In case you\u0026rsquo;re wondering why you should backup your system (for some reason), let me briefly explain. There\u0026rsquo;s always a risk of failure when you\u0026rsquo;re updating or installing a new package (to make things easier to understand, it\u0026rsquo;s basically a program), when that happens, do you want to restore your system before the error occur or you want to re-install the whole system from scratch? your choice. For me personally, i want to restore my system before the error occur rather than re-install everything from scratch. Ideally, before you install something, you should backup your system just in case there\u0026rsquo;s some trouble. If you\u0026rsquo;re insane enough to backup your system everytime you want to install new stuff or update your system then go ahead, you do you.\nIn this post, i\u0026rsquo;m gonna explain two most popular backup solution, that is clonezilla and timeshift , and also a bonus tip for arch-based linux user.\nClonezilla For the record, i\u0026rsquo;ve never tried this. I only do the research about backup on linux and this tool came up quite often. For more info on how to use this tool, you can check youtube video here .\nClonezilla is a tool to backup your entire system. That\u0026rsquo;s right, it backup your whole system. You might think \u0026ldquo;wow that\u0026rsquo;s great, i don\u0026rsquo;t need other backup tool!\u0026rdquo;, you might want to hold that thought. Yeah it backup your entire system, even your empty storage. Let me explain, for example your system has 200 GB allocated storage and let\u0026rsquo;s say you used only 100 GB so you have another 100 GB storage left. When i said clonezilla backup your entire system, it means clonezilla gonna backup the 200 GB of allocated storage for your system and not only 100 GB of used storage. So if you\u0026rsquo;re gonna install the whole system again (which is possible with clonezilla apparently), you need minimum the allocated storage space from previous machine for your system. If you didn\u0026rsquo;t provide the minimum storage space, you gonna get the error. Unless you strive for that error then it\u0026rsquo;s not gonna be a problem but if you didn\u0026rsquo;t expect the error then you might get confused. That\u0026rsquo;s the downside of clonezilla as far as i know it. I personally didn\u0026rsquo;t use it because of that downside but if it\u0026rsquo;s an advatage for you then you should try it.\nTimeshift This is a backup tool that i\u0026rsquo;ve always used since i started using linux on daily basis. The concept is simple, it made checkpoint for your system and then you can revert back to that checkpoint if something wrong after the update or after installing new stuff.\nFor arch-based linux user, this tool is a must. Arch-based linux is a rolling release linux, that means you get an update regularly and those update not always gonna work so there\u0026rsquo;s a high chance your system gonna break from the update. This tool is a livesaver.\nThe difference between this and clonezilla is that this tool only backup the used storage and also exclude the home directory (you can include backup home directory in the setting). In case you\u0026rsquo;re wandering why exclude the home directory is a default, here\u0026rsquo;s an example: If you have 3 file on your home directory, let\u0026rsquo;s just say \u0026lsquo;anu.py\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;nganu.py\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;anumu.py\u0026rsquo; then you backup your system. After backing up your system you add another file, let\u0026rsquo;s say \u0026lsquo;itumu.py\u0026rsquo;, then you revert back to the checkpoint you created previously. After you revert back, the file \u0026lsquo;itumu.py\u0026rsquo; is gone because it\u0026rsquo;s re-write everything according to checkpoint list and file \u0026lsquo;itumu.py\u0026rsquo; not in the checkpoint list yet. That\u0026rsquo;s why excluding home directory is a default, you can change it in the setting if you want.\n I\u0026rsquo;ve never used this tool on newly installed system like clonezilla did, so i\u0026rsquo;m not sure if you can using that checkpoint on newly installed system.\n Bonus Tip Here\u0026rsquo;s a bonus tip for arch-based linux user, just in case those two tools didn\u0026rsquo;t save your system (it\u0026rsquo;s not gonna hurt if you have another backup option you know).\nType this two command in your terminal:  For official arch repository: pacman -Qqen \u0026gt; pkglist-repo.txt For arch user repository (AUR): pacman -Qqem \u0026gt; pkglist-aur.txt  What it did is make a package list installed on your system from official arch repository and AUR and save it to .txt file. After that you can install all your package with those file using the command below:  For official arch repository: sudo pacman -S --needed - \u0026lt; pkglist-repo.txt For arch user repository (AUR): for x in $(cat pkglist-aur.txt); do pamac build $x; done (you can also use other alternative such as yay, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to use pamac if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to).

It can be part of desktop enviroment (DE) or be used standalone1.\n So basically window manager is how to place a window. There\u0026rsquo;re three types of window manager (according to arch wiki1): stacking (aka floating) window manager, tiling window manager, and dynamic window manager.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a brief explanation about those three window manager:\n Stacking (aka floating) Window Manager: All window manager that allow the overlapping of windows are considered stacking window manager, although it is possible that not all stacking window manager use the same method. You can check a few list of stacking window manager here . Tiling Window Manager: Tiling window manager manage the window so that no window are overlapping with each other. You can check a few list of tiling window manager here . Dynamic Window Manager: Dynamic window manager is a tiling window manager that positioned based on the preset layouts which user can switch. You can check a few list of dynamic window manager here .  For more detailed comparision of tiling window manager, you can check here .\nThe Window Manager I\u0026rsquo;ve Tried For now (at the times of writing this post), i only have tried 2 window manager. My first window manager is qtile and my second window manager is i3. You can check below for more (not really) detailed explanation(?).\ni3 Window Manager i3 is one of tiling type window manager, for more info you can check at their website . I\u0026rsquo;m just gonna explain configuration that i\u0026rsquo;ve made at my github repo . For the record, this is my current window manager (at the time writing this post). I\u0026rsquo;m using the manjaro i3 edition.\nFirst of all, i changed the mod keybinding from super key (or some people call it windows key) to alt key. You can change the mod keybinding by change set $mod Mod4 (super key) to set $mod Mod1 (alt key) in config file (you can find config file in folder .i3). For the most part i used the default config from manjaro i3 edition but i add a few program and even changed the i3 status bar with polybar. Here\u0026rsquo;s what i used in this config:\n pywal : I use this for color scheme around my i3 environment (such as terminal, border color around window, etc) polybar : I use this to replace i3 status bar because i can place the clock and date in the middle (i have no ide how to do that in i3 status bar or even py3status) and it has quite a lot of customization. You can also use py3status if you want. rofi : I use this as application manager instead of dmenu, because it\u0026rsquo;s more convenient for me (rofi appear in the middle meanwhile dmenu appear at the top). conky : I use this to take a glance what process currently taking up resources (for more detailed info i use htop). flameshot : I use this to take screenshot.  Setting Up Keybinding For setting up keybinding you can use bindsym, for example: bindsym $mod+q kill for close focused or currenly active window. Other than setting up keybindings, you can also set a program to do a certain thing, for example: set $myTerm alacritty, every thing that used $myTerm gonna access the command via terminal alacritty. Alacritty is my current (at the time of typing this post) terminal emulator, i also have xterm as a backup terminal emulator. Example of using $myTerm: bindsym $mod+e exec $myTerm -e ranger to open ranger file manager.\nSetting Up Polybar For setting up polybar, you need to move the default polybar config. In my case, the default config is in /usr/share/doc/polybar/ but if it\u0026rsquo;s not there, you can use locate polybar | grep config.\nFirst of all, make a polybar folder in .config folder. After that move the default polybar config into those folder (the path should be like this .config/polybar/config). You can change the default config to anything you want, but remember the bar name because we\u0026rsquo;re gonna use the bar name to launch the polybar. The default bar name should be like this [bar/example], you can change it to the name you want and please specify the monitor for the polybar. You can check you monitor name by typing xrandr on terminal. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example how to set a monitor in polybar config:  After i typed xrandr on my terminal, i got my laptop screen name eDP-1 so i\u0026rsquo;m gonna use my laptop screen to display the polybar.\n [bar/mainbar-i3] monitor = {env:MONITOR:eDP-1} After you\u0026rsquo;re done with your polybar config, the next step is to add launch.sh. What is launch.sh? well, it\u0026rsquo;s basically to launch all of our polybar bar config (that has this naming scheme [bar/example]). Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of launch.sh in two monitor (each bar config has different monitor assigned to it):\n#!/usr/bin/bash #Terminate already running bar instances killall -q polybar #Wait until the process have been shut down while pgrep -u $UID -x polybar \u0026gt;/dev/null; do sleep i; done #launch bar polybar mainbar-i3 \u0026amp; polybar secondbar-i3 \u0026amp; echo \u0026quot;bars launched...\u0026quot; Who Should Try or Use i3? i3 is a \u0026lsquo;manual\u0026rsquo; tiling window manager so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really have default layout which is different from dynamic \u0026lsquo;tiling\u0026rsquo; window manager, you need to specify where the window opened (whether the window opened on the right or below). If you want to use i3 you might want to consider that. So, who should try or use i3? everyone who wants a tiling window manager and doesn\u0026rsquo;t really mind to have manually control where the window appear, that\u0026rsquo;s all.\nQtile Window Manager Qtile is one of dynamic window manager that use python as basis configuration, for more info you can check at their website .\nIn my config repo i usually use MonadTall layout or Max layout. MonadTall layout basically split the first two window into half vertically and then for the third and so on gonna split the right window horisontally. Max layout basically have the application automatically take up the whole screen, that\u0026rsquo;s all. For more build-in layouts you can check their documentation here .\nI used qtile window manager first before switch to i3 because the configuration is in python but what i don\u0026rsquo;t really like is how qtile treat multiple screen. When i want to switch to second monitor, it swapped the application on second monitor to first monitor (currently active monitor) and that\u0026rsquo;s not what i want, i just want to switch to different screen and not have application on that screen swapped with application on my currently active screen. It was confusing and then i tried i3wm after that.\nThe config in my repo is a basic config i\u0026rsquo;ve done because i don\u0026rsquo;t really like the workflow of qtile. Sorry about that.\nWho Should Try or Use Qtile? If you\u0026rsquo;re fine with the workflow of qtile, wants to try or use dynamic window manager, like to have or doesn\u0026rsquo;t really mind preconfigured layout, and have experience with python then you might want to try qtile. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, qtile is good as a window manager but unfortunately it doesn\u0026rsquo;t meet my needs.\nThe Pros and Cons of Tiling Window Manager Pros:\n You don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about placement of your window because it\u0026rsquo;s automatically split the workplace for you. You use mouse less. All your application is right there without any overlap window.   Surprise, you haven\u0026rsquo;t close me yet so i\u0026rsquo;m gonna take up your computer resources.\n Cons:\n If you open too much application then the application size gonna become smaller. (that\u0026rsquo;s why use virtual desktop or workspace 1 to 8). It\u0026rsquo;s kind of hard to setting for first time. After that hard time, you can backup your previous config and use it again in other computer. Nice.  To Wrap Things Up If you want to use keyboard-oriented navigation or you don\u0026rsquo;t want to use mouse often, then you probably should try using tiling window manager. But, as i\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned above, it took time to learn how to configure it (and i think it\u0026rsquo;s worth your time).\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re still not sure, you can try it first in virtual machine (such as virtualbox or virt-manager) and then you could copy those config file to your new installation.\nExample of i3 Window Manager  Moderate use:   Too much window in one workspace can be bad:    Arch linux wiki (window manager) .\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "}]
