This concept usually called Artificial Intelligence. This attempt has gone for quite sometime, there\u0026rsquo;s even the hype cycle of it. When the artificial intelligence (a.k.a as AI) is not meet the current hype expectation, we will enter AI winter period.\nFrom my observation, if we want to make a machine behave like a human, we also need to know about human\u0026rsquo;s weakness, and one of them is inconsistency. In case anyone have not notice that yet, human can be inconsistent and that can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on the circumstances. For example, if human doing something consistent all the time, when those human doing bad things, they will consistently doing bad things for the rest of their life. But that\u0026rsquo;s not always the case, sometimes bad human can be good human too or vice versa.\nI think this is something that can be forgotten when developing artificial intelligence. Now the question is that, do we want human\u0026rsquo;s inconsistency on the machine or not? Personally i prefer the machine to be consistent or at least predictable, but i am not sure what will happen. So let\u0026rsquo;s see how this artificial intelligence development will unfold.\n"},{"ref":"https://bruhtus.github.io/posts/programmer-is-designer/","title":"Programmer is Designer","section":"posts","tags":["Reflections"],"date":"2025.11.28","body":"Recently i finished reading Peter Naur\u0026rsquo;s essay called Programming as Theory Building and i think that essay describe what i like about programming, that is \u0026ldquo;building a theory\u0026rdquo; or i usually called it \u0026ldquo;designing a system\u0026rdquo;.\nI like to think of myself as \u0026ldquo;designer\u0026rdquo; when i\u0026rsquo;m programming, because in a way, i\u0026rsquo;m basically designing some sort of mechanism to meet some specific needs. The process of finding the right mechanism is what i like about programming. And like any designer out there, if we don\u0026rsquo;t have any information about the current design we have, it\u0026rsquo;s gonna be a lot harder to modify the current design.\nFrom Naur\u0026rsquo;s ideas, we get the insight that the designer\u0026rsquo;s job is not to pass along only \u0026ldquo;the design\u0026rdquo;, but to pass along \u0026ldquo;the design\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;the theories\u0026rdquo; behind the design. That\u0026rsquo;s why when someone told me to look at the code without any explanation about the context, i got confused, what should i do with this code? The code only telling me how the system works but not telling me what is the goal of the system. Some \u0026ldquo;senior programmers\u0026rdquo; even mocking me, \u0026ldquo;can\u0026rsquo;t you just understand from looking at the code?\u0026rdquo;, and i\u0026rsquo;m like, the most i can do is create a hypothetical theory about the goal of the system which might or might not be correct. I think this is what a lot programmers forgot, without context, designing a solution for specific needs become a lot harder. Even with the proper context, designing some mechanism for the system might still be challenging, let alone without any context.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a little bit story about the \u0026ldquo;loss context\u0026rdquo;, let\u0026rsquo;s say the management moved me into another on going project, and it turns out that all members of the team is new in those project. Every programmers touching the code base for the first time, even the product manager (a.k.a PM) also new in those project, and to make things more interesting, there\u0026rsquo;s no documentation at all.\nAnd then one day, there\u0026rsquo;s some changes in the ranking system. We are changing the scoring mechanism and i\u0026rsquo;m curious about the sorting order, so i ask the PM, \u0026ldquo;Do we sort the ranking ascending or descending? Currently we are using ascending order for the ranking\u0026rdquo;. And then the PM said \u0026ldquo;Just use the same order from current implementation\u0026rdquo;. And i\u0026rsquo;m like, alright, let get working.\nAfter we finished those changes, the PM check the new implementation and surprised that the new implementation is not as the PM expected. So me and PM have a meeting, and then i try to create a simplified ranking mechanism in spreadsheet, with the data from staging environment and use that data in the score equation theory that i understand. And then we confirm that the result from equation on spreadsheet is the same as the result on the new ranking system, and the PM confirmed that the score is correct. Alright, at least we know it\u0026rsquo;s not the equation problem. After that, i tried to change the sorting order. At first, i use the ascending order on the spreadsheet, and i said \u0026ldquo;This is the current implementation, is this correct?\u0026rdquo;. After a little bit of observation by the PM, the PM said \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not correct\u0026rdquo;. After that, i use descending order, and i ask \u0026ldquo;Is this correct?\u0026rdquo;. After some observation from the PM, the PM said \u0026ldquo;Yeah, the ranking should be like that\u0026rdquo;. Okay, we found the problem and we changed the ordering from ascending to descending.\nNow, the example above makes me wonder, is the previous ranking system implementation incorrect to begin with or there\u0026rsquo;s new requirement about the order of the ranking system that the PM forgot to tell the team? At this point, we have no idea. If that is a bug, i guess we are lucky enough that no user notice that and we get to fix that because of new requirements.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why i think the theory or context about the current system is important, we can create a documentation or explain the theory or context in the comment. The \u0026ldquo;clean something\u0026rdquo; evangelist will be mad at me, they be like \u0026ldquo;write an easy to understand code so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to write the comment\u0026rdquo;. And i\u0026rsquo;m like, if you\u0026rsquo;re gonna write a comment about how the mechanism works, then i agree with that take, just write easy to understand code so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to write those type of comment. But i think comment can be useful to write why we take that approach. So mindlessly following some advice to not writing comment in a code base can be bad.\nAnd this is another part of the essay that i like. What i understand from the essay is that, there\u0026rsquo;s no right method in programming, there\u0026rsquo;s only a collection of suggestions aiming at stimulating the mental activity of the programmer, by pointing out different modes of work that may be applied in any sequence.\nBy the time of writing this post, i\u0026rsquo;ve seen a lot of programmers trying so hard to find \u0026ldquo;one great method\u0026rdquo; for everything. For those kind of programmers, this quote from the internet represent my thought:\n \u0026ldquo;One size fit all\u0026rdquo; fit nothing.\n Programming is a design process, and the design process might be different depending on the situation. So as a programmer, we need to decide which techniques to use in the current situation. That\u0026rsquo;s why i agree with the essay, all of those \u0026ldquo;best practices\u0026rdquo; are good as \u0026ldquo;a collection of suggestions\u0026rdquo;, which means that we don\u0026rsquo;t need to follow that as is, we can adjust those \u0026ldquo;best practices\u0026rdquo; to adapt for current situation or even create a new \u0026ldquo;best practice\u0026rdquo; for current situation.\nIf we think of ourselves as programmer, i think it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to have a designer mindset, which means that we are not only writing code but we are designing something with purpose and the purpose can be anything, it can be just for fun or something meaningful and if possible, pass along those purpose too so that anyone else can understand our design choices.\n"},{"ref":"https://bruhtus.github.io/posts/witch-allegation-in-ai-dystopia/","title":"Witch Allegation in AI Dystopia","section":"posts","tags":["Reflections"],"date":"2025.11.26","body":"Recently i found someone\u0026rsquo;s status about \u0026ldquo;getting accused of using AI when we didn\u0026rsquo;t\u0026rdquo;, so let\u0026rsquo;s talk about it.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the status, in case anyone curious:\nBefore we start, i just want to say that the term AI in here means \u0026ldquo;Artificial Intelligence\u0026rdquo;, not \u0026ldquo;Another Idiot\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Actual Indian\u0026rdquo;.

If we are perfect from the get go, what should we do next? Doing nothing and rot? If you say that we can do some \u0026ldquo;improvement\u0026rdquo;, that\u0026rsquo;s means we are not perfect, in case someone have not realized that yet. The perfect being won\u0026rsquo;t need improvement, what can we improve from something perfect? Nothing.\nFor me, to be open means to embrace those imperfection and to share the progress of improvement. To be open means to acknowledge there are things that we don\u0026rsquo;t know yet.

Not only learning vim motions is hard, making vim usable for the user is also hard. Well, in case someone haven\u0026rsquo;t realize, configuring vim is basically a programming activity which can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your preferences.\nBecause configuring vim is hard for new user, some people created a pre-configured vim config that they can use. At the beginning, pre-configured vim config can help new user to focus more on learning or getting used to vim motions instead of going the rabbit hole of configuring vim. Pre-configured vim config can lower the overhead for new user, but it\u0026rsquo;s not the final destination. There are some benefits we can get by configuring vim from scratch, as configuring vim is basically doing some programming. To use the programming term, you can think of vim as a \u0026ldquo;runtime\u0026rdquo; and your configuration as a script to run in those \u0026ldquo;runtime\u0026rdquo;.\nSome people like the concept of configuration like vim, which some might say \u0026ldquo;configuring by programming\u0026rdquo;, and some people don\u0026rsquo;t like it. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in using vim, I suggest you to take a look of what vim has to offer, like \u0026ldquo;configuring by programming\u0026rdquo; concept. And if that\u0026rsquo;s not your cup of tea, then maybe vim is not for you and maybe you can learn only the vim motions instead. I treat vim, the text editor, and vim motions separately because I think both of them have their own benefits independently.\nSo, what kind of benefits we can get when we try to configure vim? One of the benefits of configuring vim from scratch is that we learn about \u0026ldquo;execution order\u0026rdquo;. You might be thinking, \u0026ldquo;isn\u0026rsquo;t that the basic of programming?\u0026rdquo;. Well, you might be surprised that some programmer or software developer didn\u0026rsquo;t even care or, worse, didn\u0026rsquo;t even know about the execution order. One example from my workplace is that some developer using forEach() in javascript to do some looping, regardless of asynchronous or synchronous operation. And then one of the developers use forEach() to looping through a list of asynchronous operation. And for some reason, those developer is moved to another project. And then I got assigned to those project, and let me tell you, those looping is causing a race condition in the software because forEach() didn\u0026rsquo;t handle asynchronous operation, and I\u0026rsquo;m the one who need to fix that. Because of configuring vim, I make a habit of being conscious about the execution order, which operation get executed first. And so, that\u0026rsquo;s the first thing I checked, what order the operation get executed? And that\u0026rsquo;s where I found those \u0026ldquo;illegal racing\u0026rdquo; in the source code.\nYou might be thinking, \u0026ldquo;isn\u0026rsquo;t that kind of thinking process will come with experience?\u0026rdquo;. Yes, you\u0026rsquo;re right, and configuring vim help me to have those kind of thinking process earlier than my peer, because vim \u0026ldquo;forced\u0026rdquo; me to be mindful of the execution order of my config. It\u0026rsquo;s like what my senior software developer always said, we need to hone our \u0026ldquo;common sense\u0026rdquo; and configuring vim helping me honing my \u0026ldquo;common sense\u0026rdquo;.\nAnother thing is that because of the concept \u0026ldquo;configuring by programming\u0026rdquo;, we can also extend the functionality of vim. For example, if you know about grep tools in unix-like environment, you might already know that vim has those functionality built-in with :grep command (for more info on :help :grep). Personally, I don\u0026rsquo;t really like the default functionality of :grep command, so I make my own implementation that have the same same functionality as :grep command, which is to search any line that have the same words as the input words. Honestly, that kind of experience, creating my own implementation of some feature is exciting because I get to design the mechanism from how the user interact with the feature until how to present the result.\nOf course what I did is not as complex as most software out there, but I think we should try to design a small mechanism first before we go into a complex mechanism. And that\u0026rsquo;s why I think configuring vim is a nice intro to designing a software. You get to try to make a simple mechanism that you need or want, and going up to something like lazy loading mechanism, which can be quite complex depending on your design and expected results.\nPlease keep in mind that this is not only limited to vim, we can also get the same benefits with other software that implement \u0026ldquo;configuring by programming\u0026rdquo; concept. I just use vim as an example because for me, it\u0026rsquo;s the easiest software to start with. When I start configuring vim back in the day, my vim config is not as complex as it is now. I only have one file for my vim config back then, nowadays tho, I need a whole directory to hold all my vim config. You could say that the more I know about vim, the more my vim config grow. It\u0026rsquo;s like our vim config is growing with us, so you don\u0026rsquo;t need to know everything from the start, take your time and enjoy the process of finding things out in vim.\nAlright, that\u0026rsquo;s all from me. Happy vimming!\n"},{"ref":"https://bruhtus.github.io/posts/unintegrated-development-environment/","title":"Unintegrated Development Environment","section":"posts","tags":["Reflections"],"date":"2024.10.20","body":"After watching video about acme in this article , which introduces the concept of Integrating Development Environment instead of Integrated Development Environment which usually abbreviated to IDE, i thought to myself \u0026ldquo;why not having a development environment without integration at all?\u0026rdquo;. This might sound crazy for some people, but this is my development environment at the time of writing this post.\nJust to be clear, this approach might not be suitable for some software development, such as game development. The point is, this post is just for reference about someone else\u0026rsquo;s development environment.\nIn my time as a linux user, not even as a software developer, i realize that there\u0026rsquo;s a cost of integration and one of them is maintenance. Here\u0026rsquo;s a little bit of a back story when i found that out. Back then when i use elementary OS, which is ubuntu-based linux distro, i try to upgrade into the newer version, and guess what? I can\u0026rsquo;t use the \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; image viewer. Because i can\u0026rsquo;t use the \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; image viewer, i need another image viewer which lead me to install another image viewer. Now i have 2 image viewer on my system which i feel like redundant. So, as a new linux user, i try to uninstall the \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; image viewer, and guess what? It break the entire desktop environment. Isn\u0026rsquo;t that nice? Like hell it is!\nThat incident make me realized that when we tightly integrated our software with each other, when one software break or missing, our system might falling apart.\nAnother example is the \u0026ldquo;breaking changes\u0026rdquo; culture of modern software development. In my observation, software development nowadays does not really care about improving user experience, it\u0026rsquo;s more like making the changes for the sake of \u0026ldquo;there\u0026rsquo;s some new changes\u0026rdquo;. Whether those new changes is useful to the user or not, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter.\nThe point is, when something break because of an update in our integration system, it\u0026rsquo;s kind of hard to find out the problem. Especially if we\u0026rsquo;re using \u0026ldquo;modern software\u0026rdquo; which most likely introduce \u0026ldquo;breaking changes\u0026rdquo; on every release.\nMy base development environment is tmux, and my text editor is vim. Other than that? I use shell. The majority of my workflow is using shell. I didn\u0026rsquo;t integrate my text editor or shell with tmux. I could change my text editor or shell to something else, and it won\u0026rsquo;t effect my tmux configuration. When i changed my tmux configuration or tmux introduce breaking changes, it won\u0026rsquo;t effect my text editor or shell.\nBecause my development environment is not integrated with each other, i have the flexibility of changing things. Which can be a good thing or a bad thing, depends on personal preferences.\nSo, the point is that we need to approach integration with caution. Not everything need to be integrated with each other. We also need to realize that integration has a cost, and one of them is maintenance.\n"},{"ref":"https://bruhtus.github.io/posts/reflecting-on-intelligence/","title":"Reflecting on Intelligence","section":"posts","tags":["Reflections"],"date":"2024.05.26","body":"Over the years i\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking whether having a high intelligence is a blessing or a curse. Humans, who supposedly have the highest intelligence over other living creatures on earth, seems like having more stress than other living creatures.\nWith those high intelligence, human make a lot of innovation and one of them is electricity. One of the benefit of electricity is that electricity enable human doing activity at night, and that can cause some problems, one of them is lack of sleep. With electricity, we can even be productive at night which can cause us to forget about sleep or rest in general. When we lack of sleep, our performance will drop the next day and often times can cause some trouble during day-to-day activities. If we don\u0026rsquo;t address our lack of sleep, it will cause us some health issue.\nThe point is, with every innovations human made, human life getting more complex. For example, electricity enable us to do activity at night easily which make us need to keeping track of time so that we can have enough sleep. I\u0026rsquo;m sure there are some people who is counting how much they get to sleep before actually sleeping and in turn make those people anxious about oversleep which make their sleep not peaceful.\nThose complexity in human day-to-day life make me thinking, is having a high intelligence a good thing or a bad thing? For example, i\u0026rsquo;ve never seen an animal having lack of sleep and even if there\u0026rsquo;s an animal with lack of sleep, those animal probably in the minority. Let\u0026rsquo;s take cat for an example, have you ever see a cat keeping track of time when to sleep? Personally, i\u0026rsquo;ve never seen that kind of cat before. The kind of cat i\u0026rsquo;ve seen is the one who sleep whenever they want.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s like human trying so hard to make their life better at a cost of their freedom. I know that living in total freedom can cause a lot of problems, but that does not mean we should give up on our freedom. For example, with the innovation of instant messaging app like whatsapp, we can get an instant feedback when messaging someone. Matter fact, because of those instant messaging app, a lot of people expect we respond immediately after they send their message which can cause anxiety for some people. Let\u0026rsquo;s say you are already clock out from work at 5 PM, and then you want to enjoy dinner with your friends. In the middle of dinner, you get a message from your boss asking about some details of the project you\u0026rsquo;re currently in. Some people have the authority to ignore those kind of messages outside of working hours, but most people don\u0026rsquo;t. The point is, because of instant messaging app, the distinction between working and non-working hours almost non-existent because a lot of people expecting a fast response for their message. Yeah you should quit from those kind of company, but then again, most company do that and slowly those kind of things become a norm. It\u0026rsquo;s especially hard if you met a hypocrite who say \u0026ldquo;you should have another activity outside of working\u0026rdquo; and then the next thing they do is message you with \u0026ldquo;please submit a report for project X before 10 PM today\u0026rdquo; at 9 PM.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why i keep thinking, \u0026ldquo;is having a high intelligence a blessing or a curse?\u0026rdquo;. If we compare our life with cat\u0026rsquo;s life, our life seems more miserable than a cat.

So, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about it.\nRather than explaining about the history of AI that only a few people cares, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about what make people scared about AI.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s this topic about AI will take over humanity, or doomed humanity, or ending the humankind, etc. In my opinion, those kind of topic can become reality on one condition, when the human intelligence is lower than the artificial intelligence.\nNow, you might be thinking, \u0026ldquo;well, the current AI is smarter than me because i can\u0026rsquo;t solve those specific problem\u0026rdquo;, and guess what? The AI might not be able to solve the problem that you can solve. The AI will give a better answer if they have a better material for their training, and you know what? Human is not that different, the AI might be able to solve the problem you can\u0026rsquo;t solve because they have resources that you don\u0026rsquo;t have as their learning material (which can be questionable from the legal perspective).\nThe point is, AI also need training to increase their intelligence. Now, this is something that scared me personally. As the AI become more advance, human\u0026rsquo;s training or learning slowing down. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen a few people mindlessly take any output from the AI and present them as their answer or solution. It\u0026rsquo;s like they use AI as a reason to decrease or stop learning altogether.\nI understand that laziness can be the source of innovation, and one of those innovation is automation. Most of the time, human use automation to handle repetitive task. Will automation doomed humanity? Not really, because the most advance automation still need human supervision from time to time. Some people might lose their job because of automation, but at the same time, those kind of jobs, which do repetitive task should be left to the machine instead of human to increase human\u0026rsquo;s quality of life. If you want an example of a job that get replaced by machine, you can check the history of glass bottle, how people back in the day make glass bottle manually.\nClearly teaching a machine or a system to do some task can be beneficial for human. You could say those machine or system that human teach, is more like an assistant instead of a replacement. We, as a human, still need to supervise those machine or system, and to be able to do that, we can\u0026rsquo;t stop our learning process so that we can stop the machine or system when they misbehave and potentially endanger human life.\nSo, in this post i want to remind people that if they are scared AI will doomed humanity, then they should keep learning and prevent that from happening themselves. Do you think that human intelligence will be lower than artificial intelligence in the future? We will see.\n"}]
