The temporary object will be deleted after we evaluate the current line.\nThis is what probably happen if we use i++ without assigned the result to another variable:\n// i++; tmp = i; i = i + 1; This is what probably happen if we use ++i without assigned the result to another variable:\n// ++i; i = i + 1; tmp = i; This is what probably happen if we use i++ when assigned the result to variable j:\n// int j = i++; tmp = i; j = tmp; i = i + 1; This is what probably happen if we use ++i when assigned the result to variable j:\n// int j = ++i; i = i + 1; tmp = i; j = tmp; The only difference between i++ and ++i is when we use the value of the operation in the same statement, like int j = ++i.\nP.S:\nAt the time of writing this post, i am still learning about C, so this illustration might be wrong. Please let me know if there are a better illustration about this.\ni++ or ++i in For Loop When using either i++ or ++i in for-loop like this:\nint i; for (i = 0; i \u0026lt; 5; i++) printf(\u0026#34;%d\\n\u0026#34;, i); for (i = 0; i \u0026lt; 5; i++) printf(\u0026#34;%d\\n\u0026#34;, i); Both of them will operate identically because the increment of i and the print statement is in different line. It\u0026rsquo;s like we are using i++ or ++i without any assignment like this:\nint i = 0; i++; ++i; printf(\u0026#34;%d\\n\u0026#34;, i); Side Note Please keep in mind that operation i++ and ++i is also prone to integer overflow.\nHere an overflow example:\n#include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt;#include \u0026lt;limits.h\u0026gt; int main(void) { unsigned int i = UINT_MAX; printf(\u0026#34;before increment i: %d\\n\u0026#34;, i); i++; printf(\u0026#34;after increment i: %d\\n\u0026#34;, i); return 0; } In the example above, as we store the maximum value of unsigned integer in i and when we increase the value of i, the result would be 0 because the value is more than the maximum value of unsigned integer, so it result in overflow.\nReferences  Stackoverflow about difference between i++ and ++i .
