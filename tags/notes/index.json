When i took a look of it, using the ls -l /dev/null command, i found something like this:\n1crw-rw-rw- 1 root root 1, 3 Jun 11 04:21 /dev/null Now, what is c in the crw below\n1crw-rw-rw- 1 root root 1, 3 Jun 11 04:21 /dev/null After going around on internet, i found an answer in stackexchange1.\nIn the stackexchange, someone mentioned about info ls. That\u0026rsquo;s what pique my interest.\nReplacement For info Command When i use the command info ls i noticed that i can\u0026rsquo;t use j and k for navigation, which is disgusting.\nSo, the first thing that i need to figure out is, how to change the pager used in info command. According to this stackexchange answer2, \u0026ldquo;info doesn\u0026rsquo;t use separate pager because it handles navigation\u0026rdquo;. So, basically there\u0026rsquo;s no hope with info command? Probably.\nAnd then the person who answer on the stackexchange also give a suggestion about pinfo which, at least use j and k as up or down movement. Now i need to read the manpage about pinfo to configure it.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Next? Other than trying to configure pinfo, i might need to figure out what is the info documents is all about. This might be a new kind of documentation other than manpage that i can use (if the developer support it).\n  Stackexchange: The meaning of c in crw-rw-rw- \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Stackexchange: Replacement for info command \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "}]
