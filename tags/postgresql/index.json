Let\u0026rsquo;s call it server 1 for the source server and server 2 for the target server. But there are 2 limitations:\n We only need to replace data on specific table. We only able to access the database through psql with VPN (at least that\u0026rsquo;s how i understand it).  With that in mind, i\u0026rsquo;m trying to solve those problem with psql \\copy. Why did i use \\copy instead of sql copy? From postgres documentation:\n file accessibility and access rights depends on the client rather than the server when \\copy is used.\n If i want to retrieve the file on my local machine, using \\copy is more convenient as i use psql on my local machine.\n\\copy to Assuming we already inside psql, to copy the data from database table to csv file, we can do some like this:\n\\copy (SELECT * FROM meat) to '/home/user/meat.csv' with csv header Here\u0026rsquo;s the breakdown of the previous command means:\n SELECT * FROM meat is the sql query to get the data we want. to '/home/user/meat.csv' is the target where we want the data go into. In this case, the data will be saved in /home/user/meat.csv. with csv header is to include the column in the specified table from the select query as a csv header. This can be useful in case we want to debug the query result from csv file.  \\copy from Assuming we already inside psql, we already got the data source we want, and we already delete all the existing data (keep in mind that in this scenario, we need to replace the data). After the preparation is done, we can use this command:\n\\copy meat from '/home/user/meat.csv' delimiter ',' csv header Here\u0026rsquo;s the breakdown of the previous command means:\n meat is the target table we need to fill in. from '/home/user/meat.csv' is the target path that have the data we want. delimiter ',' is to indicate a delimiter to split the data. csv header is to indicate that the first row contains the header.  Conclusions Keep in mind that this is only one of the solution to solve the problem of replacing data from one database server to another database server and this might not be the best solution. So rather than focusing on the scenario, just treat it as something to help us understand the mechanism of psql \\copy. The point of this post is to let you know about the existence of psql \\copy and you can tweak it according to your need.\nAll right, that\u0026rsquo;s it.

Previously, i made a blog post about postgres update multiple data in one query , but those method is more convenient for running raw sql in the postgresql database directly rather than for API. I mean, sure, we can use FROM (values (...), (...), ...) but personally, i don\u0026rsquo;t really want to compose multiple values with positional parameters in postgres. And since we use pgx in golang as our postgres driver, i thought \u0026ldquo;can we put all the info we need in an array when trying to update multiple values?\u0026rdquo;, and looks like we can!\nUnnest Function I learn about the existence of unnest() from this website:\nhttps://www.w3resource.com/PostgreSQL/postgresql_unnest-function.php So, what i do is that i put all the data in a golang array. Let\u0026rsquo;s say we have pgx named arguments @ids to hold all ids that we want to update, which in this case let\u0026rsquo;s assume we use UUID as our id, and then @price to hold the data that we want to update. And the table we want to update is called meat.\nAfter validation and all those stuff, we get the necessary data and this is the query for updating multiple data with unnest() for pgx golang:\nUPDATEmeatasmSETprice=c.priceFROMunnest(@ids::uuid[],@price::int[])asc(id,price)WHEREm.id=c.idRETURNINGm.*The equivalent raw sql would be like this:\nUPDATEmeatasmSETprice=c.priceFROMunnest(array[\u0026#39;...\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;...\u0026#39;]::uuid[],array[69,42]::int[])asc(id,price)WHEREm.id=c.idRETURNINGm.*Please keep in mind that we need to specify the array type in postgres like uuid[] and int[] because apparently pgx using array in string format like unnest('{1, 2, 3}') so postgres get confused and throw an error unnest(unknown) ... unique (?). This is still an assumption and might be incorrect but the query is working fine after casting the type.\nAlso, i\u0026rsquo;m still not sure about the performance of using postgres unnest() so it\u0026rsquo;s something to keep in mind.\nAll right, that\u0026rsquo;s it.

Before we start, please keep in mind that there are other methods to get postgresql query result from remote server to local machine, the method that i mentioned after this is the easier method for me.\nAlright, let\u0026rsquo;s get to it!\nBefore we start, you need to configure the ssh stuff like private key and so on. So i will assume you already set it up in your ssh config.\nIn this post we\u0026rsquo;ll use psql to get the query result and copy() function from postgresql.\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s say we have this query:\nSELECTcount(*)asuser_countFROMusers;and we want to put those query result in user-count.csv.\nThe first thing we need to do is make a query file with the sql query above and copy() like this:\ncopy(SELECTcount(*)asuser_countFROMusers;)TOstdoutWITHcsvheaderFor simplicity, we will put those sql query in a file called query. After that, we can use this command:\nssh server-config \u0026#39;psql -d postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/db-name\u0026#39; \u0026lt; query Please keep in mind that server-config is our ssh configuration in ~/.ssh/config, and postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/db-name is our postgresql data source name (DSN).\nIf our query has result, we will see them in our terminal. Now to put those result in csv file, we can use redirection like this:\nssh server-config \u0026#39;psql -d postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/db-name\u0026#39; \u0026lt; query \u0026gt; user-count.csv And, that\u0026rsquo;s it.

How to do that? Because we use a unix timestamp which look like this 1687746597339, we need to convert those into timestamp using postgresql to_timestamp() function like this:\nto_timestamp(created_at/1000) We divide by 1000 because we multiple it by 1000 when we insert the value.\n And then, we need to truncate into a specific date. We can use date_trunc() function to truncate the date.\nAccording to the documentation, this is the parameter for date_trunc():\ndate_trunc(field,source[,time_zone])Valid values for field are:\n microseconds milliseconds second minute hour day week month quarter year decade century millennium  source is either timestamp or interval and return timestamp or interval depending on the source.\ntime_zone is an optional parameter to specify a different timezone. By default, truncation is done with the current timezone setting.\nIf we combine date_trunc() and to_timestamp(), we will get something like this:\ndate_trunc(\u0026#39;week\u0026#39;,to_timestamp(created_at/1000))If we make the entire query, it would be something like this (let\u0026rsquo;s say the table name is participants):\nSELECTdate_trunc(\u0026#39;week\u0026#39;,to_timestamp(created_at/1000))ASweekly,COUNT(*)AStotal_participantsGROUPBYweeklyORDERBYweeklyASC;And the result would be something like this:\nweekly|total_participants------------------------+-------------------------- 2023-06-1900:00:00+07|694202023-06-2600:00:00+07|69 00:00:00+07 is because the timezone setting on my database is asia/jakarta which is basically UTC+7. If your timezone setting is different, the timestamp might be different.\nStill not sure why the date_trunc() with field week start at monday, and, at the time of writing this post, i haven\u0026rsquo;t found a settings to change that.\n Alright, that\u0026rsquo;s it.

Let\u0026rsquo;s say you want to change value on table A where the name is anu on year 2019, 2020, and 2021.\nRather than doing 3 query with different WHERE statement, we can do that with one query. Without further ado, let\u0026rsquo;s go straight to it!\nFROM statement Postgresql has FROM clause in UPDATE statement which let us use columns on other table, it use the same syntax as FROM clause in SELECT statement.\nWe can combine FROM clause with VALUES expression. VALUES in postgresql let us create a constant table which means we can generate a table with constant values that can be used in a query without having to actually create and populate the table on disk.\nNow here\u0026rsquo;s an example case:\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say we need to update the price rows on area tokyo at table meat with year 2019, 2020, and 2021.
