I like doing some experiment, trying things out, and analyze the results.
I'm interested in technology and automation, basically I like to automate things.

Other than tech, I'm also interested in photography and sexology.

Well that's all,
I'm still figuring out what it means to live the life of a human being
so I can't really explain much.
