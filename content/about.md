I like doing some experiment, trying things out, and analyze the results.
I'm interested in shell scripting, tinkering with software (such as vim),
eink device, mechanical keyboard, and photography.

I'm not the type of person who can do something if I try,
I'm the type of person who tries until I can do something.

Well, that's all.
I still have no idea what it means to live the life of a human being,
so I can't really explain much.
