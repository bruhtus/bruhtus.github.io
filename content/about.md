> To make things simpler I introduced myself as bertus and sometimes bruhtus.

I like doing some experiment, trying things out, and analyze the results.
I'm interested in technology and automation, basically I like to automate things.

Other than tech, I'm also interested in photography, psychology, and sexology.
Observing the humans so that I can make a smooth user experience is a fun activity (at least for me).

Well that's all, I'm still figuring out what it must be to live the life of a human being so I can't really explain much.

> Did I ever know myself at all? I'm not sure.
