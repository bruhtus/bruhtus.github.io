Recently i found someone's status about "getting accused of using AI when we
didn't", so let's talk about it.

Here's the status, in case anyone curious:<br>
![witch-allegation-in-ai-dystopia](witch-allegation-in-ai-dystopia.jpg)

Before we start, i just want to say that the term AI in here means
"Artificial Intelligence", not "Another Idiot" or "Actual Indian". With that
in mind, let's get started.

At the time of writing this post, AI become trending again. If anyone still
remember, this is not the first time AI trending. There's even the term [AI
winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter) and maybe we can create a
machine learning model to predict the next "AI hype cycle"? Who knows.

Anyway, because AI trending, a lot of people using AI to generate a bunch of
stuff but the thing is that, some of those people who use AI did not admit
that they use AI. They want other people to think that it is their own
creation without putting a lot of effort. Because of these people, i have seen
some kind of "witch allegation" going on, like "there's no way you did this,
you are using AI, right?!!" and if you notice, that is kind of similar to
"you are a witch, aren't you?!!".

If people keep being dishonest about their usage of AI, this "witch
allegation" might keep going until we enter "AI winter" again, or worse, this
current "AI hype cycle" will leave "scar" in society, that is trust issue
about any form of creation.

P.S:<br>
If you think that i wrote this post using AI, congratulation, you have just
prove my point. Just to be clear, i did not use AI to write this post or any
of my blog post, unless i explicitly said otherwise. I realize that my writing
skill is still bad, so that is why i keep writing blog post, as a writing
exercise. I want to __learn__ how to write down my thoughts and that's why
this blog post exists.
