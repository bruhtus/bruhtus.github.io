At the time of writing blog post, human still trying to emulate human's
intelligence on machine. This concept usually called Artificial Intelligence.
This attempt has gone for quite sometime, there's even the hype cycle of it.
When the artificial intelligence (a.k.a as AI) is not meet the current hype
expectation, we will enter
[AI winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter) period.

From my observation, if we want to make a machine behave like a human, we
also need to know about human's weakness, and one of them is inconsistency. In
case anyone have not notice that yet, human can be inconsistent and that can
be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on the circumstances. For example,
if human doing something consistent all the time, when those human doing bad
things, they will consistently doing bad things for the rest of their life.
But that's not always the case, sometimes bad human can be good human too or
_vice versa_.

I think this is something that can be forgotten when developing artificial
intelligence. Now the question is that, do we want human's inconsistency on
the machine or not? Personally i prefer the machine to be consistent or at
least predictable, but i am not sure what will happen. So let's see how this
artificial intelligence development will unfold.
