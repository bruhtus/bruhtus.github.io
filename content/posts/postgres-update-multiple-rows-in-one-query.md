## A Brief Intro

Have you ever wondering how to update multiple rows with one query? Let's say
you want to change value on table A where the name is `anu` on year 2019,
2020, and 2021.

Rather than doing 3 query with different `WHERE` statement, we can do that
with one query. Without further ado, let's go straight to it!

## FROM statement

Postgresql has `FROM` clause in `UPDATE` statement which let us use columns on
other table, it use the same syntax as `FROM` clause in `SELECT` statement.

We can combine `FROM` clause with `VALUES` expression. `VALUES` in postgresql
let us create a constant table which means we can generate a table with
constant values that can be used in a query without having to actually create
and populate the table on disk.

Now here's an example case:<br>
Let's say we need to update the `price` rows on `area` tokyo at table
`meat` with year `2019`, `2020`, and `2021`. We can make the query like this:
```sql
UPDATE meat
SET price = new.price
FROM (values
    (6942, 2019),
    (69420, 2020),
    (69690, 2021),
) AS new(price, year)
WHERE meat.area ILIKE 'tokyo'
AND meat.year = new.year
RETURNING *;
```

> The `RETURNING` clause is optional, it's a way to check if we really changed the
> right rows or not. The `ILIKE` clause is an expression for insensitive case.

You can change the `new` in `new(price, year)` with anything you like.
Alright, that's it. See you next time!
