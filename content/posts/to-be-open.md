Recently i watch a talk by Lu Wilson on youtube about [What it means to be
open](https://youtu.be/MJzV0CX0q8o?si=VrL-WJwZ9_rhSQMd) and that talk kind of
resonates with me because that's exactly what i am trying to achieve, which is
"to be open".

It's not only about the source code, it's about being human. Nowadays i feel
like there is some kind of pressure "to be perfect", "to have no mistake", "to
never failed", and so on. But that's not what human is, human is imperfect
being and how can some imperfect being define "perfection"?

Those imperfection is not a bad thing, because we can explore the possibility
to make something better. If we are perfect from the get go, what should we do
next? Doing nothing and rot? If you say that we can do some "improvement",
that's means we are not perfect, in case someone have not realized that yet.
The perfect being won't need improvement, what can we improve from something
perfect? Nothing.

For me, to be open means to embrace those imperfection and to share the
progress of improvement. To be open means to acknowledge there are things that
we don't know yet. And what i want to achieve by being open is to find some
sort of fellowship with other like-minded people, to not be shy sharing what we
are trying to do and help each other out.
