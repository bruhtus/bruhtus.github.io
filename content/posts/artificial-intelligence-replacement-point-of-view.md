When we talk about something that have "artificial" in it, we tend to
associate that with something that "does not exist naturally". But recently i
read article titled [Bag of words, have mercy on
us](https://www.experimental-history.com/p/bag-of-words-have-mercy-on-us), and
this footnote caught my attention:
> Even the word “artificial” is wrong, because it menacingly implies
> replacement. Artificial sweeteners, flowers, legs—these are things we only use
> when we can’t have the real deal. So what part of intelligence, exactly, are
> we so intent on replacing?

Well, i guess we can interpret "artificial" like that. And that footnote make
wonder, what are we trying to replace with artificial intelligence?

Some people might be saying "no one is gonna be replaced by artificial
intelligence", well, it depends. The problem with the current Artificial
Intelligence (a.k.a AI) hype cycle is that some people _too dependent_ on it,
and what this implies is that, these people might be _limiting_ themselves to
the output of AI. So if the AI did not have the answer for them, they might
not be able to find the answer themselves. In a way, we can think of this as a
"replacement" process. Some people's intelligence is slowly being replaced by
artificial intelligence, and they might not even aware of it.

When i heard some people said that they _can't live_ without AI anymore, and i
feel like there's some problem here, but i don't know what the problem is. And
when i read those footnote, the previous statement that some people can't live
without AI anymore make me thinking, "are we in the replacement process
already?".

So here's another point of view, AI is not replacing the human themselves but
replacing the human's intelligence. With that in mind, use AI wisely or you
are at the risk of your intelligence _unconsciously_ being replaced by
artificial intelligence.
