At the time of writing this post, there's some sort of AI hype going around,
and some of the testimonies is that AI make people "learn faster" or
"doing stuff faster". With that in mind, let's talk about how this mentality
can be bad.

First off, some people want to "learn faster", and i'm like _and then what_?
What would these people do after learning as fast as they can? Scrolling
social media? If that is your goal, then i think you are putting the horse
before the cart.

Personally, i try to have this "student mentality" where i treat learning
as daily activity. I don't want to rush my learning process because i don't
want to have a premature knowledge. In my unscientific observation, the
biggest problem of self-learner is that some of them tend to be
"overconfident". Those people tend to blindly believe with the _only_
reference they have, without even considering that the reference can be
misleading. As a self-learner myself, this is the reason i don't want my
learning phase to end as fast as possible. I don't want to be overconfident
and think that i've learn everything that is to learn. There's a possibility
that what i've learn this far is not accurate, especially if i don't have any
experience with the topic.

If you just _blindly_ trust what AI say without any experience in the subject,
then i think it can be more _harmful_ rather than helpful. AI can be good to
find _the unknown_, finding something that we didn't know before, _and then_
find some proper references for those subject. We could say that AI make the
process of _finding the unknown_ faster than reading the documentation
ourself, but are we really learning faster that way? How can we be sure that
we're done learning the subject? If you are trying to learn as fast as
possible, you might set up yourself for premature knowledge.

Now, let go into "doing stuff faster", again, _and then what_? In the past,
i've been working so fast that my team leader asking me to slow down because
other teammates _can not keep up_ with my pace, and that was _before_ the
current AI hype cycle. Whether you believe me or not, i've been in a position
to _do things as fast as possible_ and that do more harm to the team rather
than being helpful.

You might be thinking, "then your teammates need to raise up their pace",
_and then what_? We are racing to see who can finish the most tasks and got
burned along the way? Believe it or not, i've experience that too. For some
reason, the people on the teams trying to compete to see who can finish
the most task in the team, this happen _in_ the current AI hype cycle. In
those team, i'm _the slow one_ because i've seen how exhausted my teammates
in previous team when i set the pace too high, so i intentionally slowing
down pace. __But__, that does not mean i become slow, i just putting
off my result out there.

Here's an example, let's say i need to make some feature, i already done
that with "mechanism A", but i did not submit "mechanism A" and instead
i am trying to brainstorming again and change "mechanism A" to "mechanism B",
and then i have another idea and change "mechanism B" to "mechanism C".
After that, i don't really have any inspiration to improve "mechanism C" so
i submit "mechanism C". That's what i mean by slowing down, i just putting
off the result.

That's why i feel like "doing stuff faster" is not always a good thing,
especially when we are working with a team. Setting the pace too high might
not be sustainable in the long run. Unless that's your goal, you don't want to
stay long enough in the industry.

Another example of "doing stuff faster" is _instant messaging_. When the first
instant messaging application appear, a lot of people enjoying it, they be
like "wow, we can contact other people _instantly_" and then years latter
realizing that _instant messaging_ setting the bar too high for _how fast_ we
should respond. Because of instant messaging, a lot of people expect us to
respond __immediately__, it's like our entire time is just waiting on
instant messaging application. These expectation can create anxiety in some
cases, and one of them is when working remotely. When we are working remotely,
we can working from anywhere as long as we have internet access, but the dark
side of working remotely is that, when we don't separate _working_ and
_resting_ phase, we will be working 24 hours a day. And if our company did not
have a clear policy, we will be in _sword of damocles_ situation, basically
it's like we have a _sword_ hanging above our head all day long.

These mindset that we need to be "faster" or the expectation for something to
be "instant" can be harmful for the society in some cases, so we need to keep
that mindset in check.
