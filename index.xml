Ok, first thing first, there is a git command clean which help us delete the untracked file. We can even use it with interactive interface. To invoke the interactive interface, we can use this command:
git clean -i .

To make things short, basically i was inspired by Kevin Hazy&amp;rsquo;s project here . After i see Kevin&amp;rsquo;s project, i was like &amp;ldquo;can i make almost the same thing with python?&amp;rdquo; and that was the trigger.
If you ask me why i want a tool (kind of) to save instagram post, that&amp;rsquo;s because i have a hard time to save video memes on instagram and i don&amp;rsquo;t really want to use a screen recorder (said the guy who made something that took longer than learning how to use screen recorder and edit the result 👀).</description></item><item><title>Tiling Window Manager For Efficiency</title><link>https://bruhtus.github.io/posts/tiling-window-manager/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bruhtus.github.io/posts/tiling-window-manager/</guid><description>A brief explanation about tiling window manager and configuration tiling window manager that i&amp;rsquo;ve tried.
